      <description>Disclaimer: This article is the opinion of the author and does not necessarily reflect that of all Teachers&#39; Christian Fellowship members.
Behaviour Management Strategies for High School SRE Teachers Make the school a priority rather than just one lesson a week. Find out what happens there.
 Get to know the kids in your school and be known by them.
Learn some of their names. Build relationships with the kids not as their best friend but as one of their teachers.</description>
