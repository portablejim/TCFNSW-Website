Woo gave the Australia Day address in NSW in 2018, the first time a teacher has done so.
He is married with three children and enjoys playing the guitar.
Woo identifies as a Christian, stating, "We talk about the fact that the universe is designed in this way and you can find all of these patterns; do you think that that's a coincidence? One of the things I love to point out is we call the universe the cosmos which means ordered and structured and designed, as opposed to chaos, and the reason why we can find these mathematical principles is because there was a designer. We didn't just spring into being. It has immense beauty.” Source: Wikipedia

    <h4>Vale John Dowe</h4>
    <p>John Dowe joined TCF in 1952. After only a few years of teaching he went into full time ministry with the Anglican Church. He served faithfully in the Diocese of Armidale as vicar at Walgett, Narrabri and Uralla. He served a few years with CMS as a lecturer at a Bible College in the Solomon Islands. He retired to Katoomba from where he continued to minister as a locum in a number of parishes. He and his wife, Clair, moved to the Anglican retirement Village at Castle Hill for the last part of his life where they attended St Matthews, West Pennant Hills and then St James Chapel at the village. Throughout this life John remained a loyal TCF member until his very last day on this earth! Well done, good and faithful servant.</p>

	<h4>Its a Privelege</h4>
	<p>John provides some background to the current debate about school funding in an article <a href="htmarticles/Privelege.html" title="Privelege">Its a Privelege?</a> and compares it to Biblical principles to care for the poor. How do you balance the issues of choice and equality in your Christian ethics? Are government schools the best way to help the poor? What is the difference between high and low fee paying schools? Join the discussion on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/126165657429402/" target="_blank" title="Facebook page">Facebook</a>.</p>
	<h4>Public Schools fight back</h4>
  <p>Should we have selective public schools? Why do they exist? A recent article "<a href="htmarticles/Public-Schools-fight.html" title="Article about selective, government and non-government schools">Public Schools fight back</a>" discusses selective schools and non-government schools. Why do you think parents choose non-government schools? Share your thoughts on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/126165657429402/" target="_blank" title="Facebook page">Facebook</a>.</p>
    <h4>20+ years of Literacy and numeracy</h4>
    <embed src="images/Australia_G9-69.svg" style="float: left; padding-right: 6px;" >
    <p>John has shared an extensive discussion about literacy and numeracy in schools which includes many other issues related to this. What do the NAPLAN results show if anything about Australian schools? Read the article "<a href="htmarticles/Literacy-and-numeracy.html" title="Article about literacy and numeracy standards and testing">Going backwards: 20+ years of a literacy and numeracy focus</a>", together with the postscript "<a href="htmarticles/Gonski.html" title="Gong for Gonski" target="_blank">Gong for Gonski</a>" and share your thoughts about schooling in Australia on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/126165657429402/" target="_blank" title="Facebook page">Facebook</a>. </p>
