<h2>About us</h2>
<p>Teachers' Christian Fellowship of New South Wales (TCFNSW Inc) exists to promote a Christian perspective in education and support Christian teachers. It is interested in all areas of education from a Christian perspective of which religious education is but one part.</p>
<p>The Fellowship is open to all teachers and educators and is governed by an executive elected by those members who sign a statement of the Christian faith.</p>
<p>TCFNSW has a long history that begins in the 1930s. For much of that time it has operated to provide support to Christian teachers and educators. More recently it has embraced a wider mission to engage all teachers and educators in consideration of educational issues from a Christian perspective.</p>
<p>Members receive a monthly newsletter and have reduced fees to conferences and other activities that are open to all teachers and educators.</p>
