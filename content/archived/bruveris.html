      <h3>ATTENTION DIFFICULTIES</h3>
<p>Ilona Bruveris, Senior Adviser, Student Behaviour Support, NSW
Department of Education and Training</p>
      
      <p>Rudolf Dreikurs wrote about the need for teachers to have &#8220;withit-ness&#8221;. By
this he meant having a feel for the many layers of interaction in a
classroom, understanding how students were progressing with set tasks
and ensuring that issues were addressed quickly so that they could not
escalate into a crisis situation.</p>
      <p>In order to
develop a sense of &#8220;withit-ness&#8221; teachers need to have information on a
wide range of issues surrounding student behaviour. This includes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Academic strengths and weaknesses of students</li>
        <li> How the students respond to universal classroom strategies
and structures such as the class rules and specific targeted programs</li>
        <li> Difficulties with social skills in terms of knowledge of
the skills, performance of the skills or<br>
fluency of social skill use</li>
        <li> Individual needs such as the student&#8217;s sense of belonging,
self-concept and external factors that may impact on interactions in
the classroom such as any specific medical needs, safety or wellbeing
needs</li>
        <li> What functions his/her current behaviour fulfils and what
are alternative behaviours, which could help the students to meet
his/her needs.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>As an example
a student who has difficulties with attention may have a specific
diagnosis of ADHD, be in a fluent home environment, see himself/herself
as a poor performer academically and worthless, have difficulties with
literacy and may not have yet developed skills in self-management,
problem-solving etc.</p>
      <p>In order to
address such a wide range of needs a range of strategies may need to be
employed:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> Curriculum adaptations</li>
        <li> Instructional modifications</li>
        <li> Environmental accommodations</li>
        <li> Behavioural support</li>
        <li> Peer support, peer mediation, peer tutoring</li>
        <li> Flexible scheduling</li>
        <li> Social skills instruction integrated into the curriculum</li>
        <li> Active communication</li>
        <li> Flexible programming, increase or decrease restrictiveness</li>
        <li> Alternative disciplinary responses</li>
        <li> Concrete and frequent feedback about appropriateness of
behaviour</li>
        <li> Determining the function of misbehaviour and substituting
more appropriate behaviours</li>
        <li> Use techniques that address social isolation - peer
tutoring, co-operative learning groups</li>
        <li> Moving from reactive rule-breaking school discipline to a
proactive teaching model.</li>
        <li> Establishing classroom routine, communicating behavioural
expectations, limiting non-instructional activities, controling student
transitions, identifying the required behaviours and preparing students
to engage in these behaviours.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>After analysing factors which impact on the students&#8217; ability to pay
attention, the workshop will<br>
focus in particular on strategies which help teachers to manage
students with ADHD.</p>
      <ul>
        <li> Keep work periods short</li>
        <li> Reduce delays, externalise time</li>
        <li> Externalise important information</li>
        <li> Externalise motivation (think win/win)</li>
        <li> Externalise problem-solving (play)</li>
        <li> Use immediate feedback</li>
        <li>Increase accountability to others</li>
        <li> Use more salient and artificial rewards</li>
        <li> Change rewards periodically</li>
        <li> Act, don&#8217;t yak</li>
        <li> Keep your sense of humour</li>
        <li> Use rewards before punishment</li>
        <li> Anticipate problem settings - make a plan</li>
        <li> Keep a sense of priorities</li>
        <li> Maintain a sense of perspective</li>
        <li> Practice forgiveness &#8211; of the student and yourself.</li>
      </ul>
      <p >In order to
be effective in working with students with attention problems, remember
to consider all of the factors that are needed to manage complex change:</p>
