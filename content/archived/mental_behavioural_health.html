 <h4>Mental
     and behavioural health - Old problem, new solution?</h4>
    
      <p>Over the last three
years there has been increasing discussion of a report, <i>Hardwired to connect: A new scientific
case of Authoritative Communities</i>, by the Commission on Children
at Risk a coalition of researchers from YMCA USA, Dartmouth Medical
School and the Institute of American Values.&nbsp; It postulates that,
amidst unprecedented material affluence, the mental and behavioural
health of US children and adolescents is deteriorating as evidenced by
high and rising rates of depression, conduct disorders and thoughts of
suicide.</p>
      <p>
The evidence sighted includes 21% of US children aged 9-17 have
diagnosable mental or addictive disorders, the current generation is
more likely to be depressed than their parents, 20% of students report
having seriously considered suicide, youth homicide has increased 130%
since 1950 and youth suicide by 140%. Adolescents from immigrant
families are less likely than US-born adolescents to experience school
absences due to health and emotional problems and less likely to engage
in risky behaviours.</p>
      <p>
The report argues that the current models of treatment by prescription
drugs, a focus on the extremes and early intervention are inadequate
and that a structural, systemic and social solution is required. The
basis for its recommendations (see further on) are based on an argued
scientific case that the brain develops best in the context of
relationship with other brains establishing a resilience to psychiatric
disorders. The case is extensively argued and can be read from various
presentations available on the web. Just type &#8220;Hardwired to connect&#8221;
into a search engine. (I used Google).&nbsp; I am not a scientist and
can not argue the merits or otherwise of the extensive scientific case
that is put forward. </p>
      <p>
Some of the conclusions are: that adolescent risk-taking and
novelty-seeking behaviours are connected to changes in brain structure
and function; that differences in gender, meaning and well-being are
attributable to both environmental and biological factors; human
communities across time and culture help to define and enforce social
meaning and meet gender needs; and that morality is associated with a
biological attachment. It is this emphasis on attachment or
connectedness that leads to the description of the problem facing
children and young people: there has been a breakdown in close
connections to other people and associated with this breakdown, a loss
of deep connections to moral and spiritual meaning. The question is
asked: where do children find moral and spiritual meaning if their
families are dysfunctional, their parents often physically and
emotionally absent and no other significant adult relates to them
directly?&nbsp; For older children, the question is raised about the
social, not only personal well-being of the child by asking the
question about their connectedness to school and other social groups
that can provide meaning and connectedness. </p>
      <p>
It is in this context that religion is seen to provide meaning and
connectedness. However, this is a very broad view of spirituality and
religion. It is not a case for Christianity alone, but an opportunity
for Christians to share their experience to help others fill this gap
in their development. The research indicates that those who attend a
church and are involved in church youth groups are less likely to show
the risk-taking and novelty-seeking behaviours, but so to are those
connected to other social groups, especially those focused on helping
others. </p>
      <p>
There are many programs in the community, and increasingly in schools,
that focus on service learning as a way to connect young people to
their communities and to develop meaning and connectedness. These
programs represent an opportunity for Christians, especially Christian
teachers, to contribute to the development of young people and to go a
step further by introducing them to churches with effective children&#8217;s
and youth work so that they might discover Jesus. The report concludes
by emphasising the need for children and young people to be attached to
&#8220;authoritative communities&#8221; which are characterised as: inclusive of
children and youth, focused on children and youth needs, caring, able
to set clear expectations and limits, comprising non-specialists,
multigenerational, long-termed focused, promoting a shared
understanding of what it means to be a good person, encouraging
spiritual development and oriented to the principle of &#8220;love thy
neighbour&#8221;. Is your school or church an authoritative community?<br>
