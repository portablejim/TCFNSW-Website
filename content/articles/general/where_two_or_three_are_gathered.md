I wonder how many TCFers have enjoyed the opportunity of having prayer fellowship with members of their staff in government schools?

From my teaching career in Broken Hill High School in 1950 till I finished at Katoomba High in 1987, I had the privilege of prayer fellowship in many schools with other Christian teachers. Some had small numbers and larger numbers in other schools.

We always found lots to pray for: other teachers, students in the school, ISCF ministry and specifically “difficult” students.

Why don’t you try meeting with others, even if only one or two, to pray for the school you are teaching in and /or for local schools in your area.
