     <h3>WHICH VALUES DO I TEACH IN A MULTI-FAITH SOCIETY?</h3>
<p>Professor Brian Hill, M.A., B. Ed., Ph.D., FACE, Emeritus
Professor of Education, formerly Murdoch University, Perth </p>
           <span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">You&#8217;ve
asked me to address a very hard question: &#8220;Which values do I teach in a
Multi-faith Society?&#8221;&nbsp; This question presumes that its possible to
find a workable solution in a pluralistic society like ours.&nbsp; It
assumes that somewhere there&#8217;s a bounded set of core values, however
minimal, which will enable Australian schools to keep their act
together.&nbsp; Indeed, have not the divinities who dwell by Lake
Molonglo decreed that there shall be <span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">nine</span> core values?</span><br
 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">
      <br style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">
      <span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">But maybe
it&#8217;s wishful thinking to suppose that a value consensus can be
achieved.&nbsp; Maybe those divinities haven&#8217;t walked the side roads of
our cities lately.&nbsp; Some people say values have become so
pluralised today that any attempt to capture the essence of the
Australian way of life will be futile.&nbsp; There are <span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">many</span> ways of
life, ranging from fundamentalism to hedonism, and from liberalism to
terrorism. In Australia!&nbsp; The gap between rich and poor is
widening, and the majority of people, having been baptised by
postmodernism and confirmed by consumerism, do what is right in their
own eyes. <small>1.</small> </span><br
 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">
      <br style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">
      <span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">So it&#8217;s
too late!&nbsp; All that&#8217;s left to us now is to make more laws
controlling people&#8217;s public behaviour, and increase the police presence
to enforce them.&nbsp; What they do in private is their own business,
so long as they don&#8217;t harm anyone else.</span><br
 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">
      <br style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">
      <span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">That&#8217;s the
gospel of political liberalism, but also, it seems, of many
churches.&nbsp; The two values which both political and theological
liberals promote more than any other are &#8220;tolerance&#8221; and
&#8220;inclusion&#8221;.&nbsp; They&#8217;re even enshrined in the rather messy ninth
value in the National frame&not;work.&nbsp; It&#8217;s bad form to ask the
million-dollar question &#8220;tolerance how far, and inclusion of
what?&#8221;&nbsp; But unless these values are defined, they&#8217;re mere
tranquillisers, masking the effects of deep divisions and religious
extremisms.&nbsp; So is it time for Christians to throw in the sponge
and retreat into a sub-cultural ghetto?</span><br
 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">
      <br style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">
      <br style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">
      <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">FOUR
REASONS TO WORK FOR CONSENSUS</span><br
 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">
      <br>
      <span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">My answer
to that question is an expression of faith; but not blind faith.&nbsp;
Let me give you four reasons why it&#8217;s worthwhile for Christians to be
involved in public efforts to work towards a more robust value
consensus &#8211; in our society, and in <span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">all</span> our schools.<br>
      <br style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">
      </span><span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">1. Common grace</span><br>
      <br style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">
      </span><span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">The
first is what Christian theologians call &#8220;common grace,&#8221; by which they
mean that the grace of God is extended to both the just and the unjust.<small><small>2</small></small>
&nbsp; Primarily this refers to God&#8217;s continuing love even for those
who don&#8217;t acknowledge him.&nbsp; He hasn&#8217;t deserted them in a
huff.&nbsp; He replenishes the earth and restrains gross evil, while
his servants continue to spread the good news of how to get right with
God.&nbsp; He doesn&#8217;t take us out of the world, and he doesn&#8217;t endorse
our taking ourselves out of the world.<br>
      <br style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">
      </span><span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">A
further aspect of his common grace is that even sinners are not totally
lacking in awareness of his law.&nbsp; Made in his image, albeit now an
image distorted by sin, we still sense the fundamental values built
into our natures, and the difference beween right and wrong.<small><small>3</small></small>
&nbsp; If this were not so, society would disintegrate and fall back on
the rule of the jungle.&nbsp; One thing that should disturb us greatly
is that there&#8217;s been a succession of nations in the last century where
this did happen, and this was universally viewed, not as a normal state
of affairs, but as a disaster.<br>
      <br style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">
      </span><span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">C.
S. Lewis once combed the literature of a number of civilisations past
and present round the globe.&nbsp; He claimed that, despite developing
independent of each other, they agreed on an impressive number of basic
moral ideas.&nbsp; Mind you, he&#8217;d be the first to say that this doesn&#8217;t
remove the need for the special grace that brings us salvation from
sin.&nbsp; As I emphasised this morning, knowing the good doesn&#8217;t
automatically mean you&#8217;ll do it.&nbsp;&nbsp; But it suggests that
negotiations between people with different world-views won&#8217;t
necessarity fail.<br>
&nbsp;<br style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">
      </span><span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">Recently
a rabbi wrote to me urging me to consider what many Jewish thinkers
call &#8220;the Noahide Laws.&#8221;&nbsp; This term refers, they say, to the seven
laws which God gave Noah after the flood.&nbsp; Just out of interest,
in summary they are as follows:</span><br
 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">
      <br style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">
      <span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">1&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;- Do not worship false gods.</span><br
 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">
      <span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">2&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;- Do not murder.</span><br
 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">
      <span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">3&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;- Do not steal (or kidnap).</span><br
 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">
      <span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">4&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;- Do not be sexually immoral.</span><br
 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">
      <span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">5&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;- Do not blaspheme against God.</span><br
 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">
      <span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">6&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;- Do not be cruel to animals.</span><br
 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">
      <span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">7&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;- Maintain a system of justice for all. <small><small>4</small></small>
      <br>
      <br style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">
      </span><span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">The
implication is that this pre-Mosaic code constitutes a universal ethic
by which God will judge non-Jews, while the Ten Commandments add
provisions specifically applicable to the Chosen People.&nbsp; Well,
whether this is a sufficient description of a universal ethic or not,
it adds weight to the policy of entering into negotiations with people
of diverse world-views in an attempt to find areas of practical
agreement.<small><small>5</small></small><br>
      <br>
      <br style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">
      </span><span
 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; font-weight: bold;">2.&nbsp;
Promising Experiments<br>
      <br style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">
      </span><span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">The
second reason for attempting to go down this road is the evidence that
in Australia in the last decade or so there have been a number of
promising attempts to identify core values.&nbsp; Several states
including New South Wales have developed values frameworks, and I&#8217;ve
already mentioned the ongoing Commonwealth Values Education
Program.&nbsp; I sometimes call them &#8220;attempts which have not (yet)
failed&#8221;, because negotiations of this kind will always be ongoing, open
to revision depending on which voices gain the most attention.&nbsp;
Provisionally, though, they prove it can be done.&nbsp; And Christians
are challenged to have their legitimate say.<br>
      <br style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">
      </span><span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">My
most direct involvement in such an exercise was a review in the mid-90s
of the Dawkins Curriculum, carried out by a West Australian consortium
of independent school systems.&nbsp; Negotiations with Christian,
Jewish and Muslim systems resulted in a robust framework of about 60
value statements (not just single-word terms) designed to guide
educational effort.&nbsp; Once it was recognised that we were looking
for an Agreed Minimum rather than a compre&not;hensive system everyone
would be expected to agree to, reason and good will achieved a level of
consensus no-one had dreamed possible.<br>
      <br style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">
      </span><span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">I
need to add that people who are skeptical about even making such
attempts should realise that logically they are hardly the right people
to be active in state education.&nbsp; School education is by
definition the teaching of things that the sponsoring community
considers valuable.&nbsp; Those why try to fall back on the supposed
neutrality of just teaching &#8220;knowledge and skills&#8221;, as if these were
somehow free of value issues, are kidding themselves &#8211; or trying to kid
us.<br>
      <br>
      <br style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">
      </span><span
 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; font-weight: bold;">3.&nbsp;
The Christian Heritage<br>
      <br style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">
      </span><span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">The
next two reasons for making the attempt are more specifically
Christian.&nbsp; One concerns the Christian element in our Australian
heritage.&nbsp; For some time, a few Christian scholars, like Dr Stuart
Piggin at Macquarie University, in his <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Spirit of a Nation</span>, have been
arguing that the writing and teaching of Australian history has been at
fault because historians have consistently played down the role of
strong Christian devotion and service to the community.&nbsp; This
concern came to a head in a conference hosted in July in Canberra by
the Parliamentary Christian Fellowship, and organised by National Forum
on Australia&#8217;s Christian Heritage.&nbsp; I mentioned it briefly this
morning and I&#8217;d like to say a bit more about it now.<br>
      <br style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">
      </span><span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">Most
of the papers delivered at the conference are now on the website.<small><small>6</small></small>
&nbsp; Leading historians argued strongly at the forum that our
present-day culture relies considerably on its legacy of such Christian
values as compassion, equality of all persons before God, and
liberation of the oppressed.&nbsp; They further suggested that we were
at risk of having many of our most distinctive Australian values and
practices rolled back by our cultural slide into hedonism, consumerism,
and the privatisation of care.<small><small>7</small></small> <br>
      <br style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">
      </span><span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">Enough
of this values legacy is still embedded in the sub-conscious of
Australians who might otherwise appear to be indifferent to the
Christian gospel, to justify efforts to bring it out into the open
through public negotiations.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is no time for
Christians to be running away from the public domain.&nbsp; We have a
right to be prominent in the debate to identify core Australian values.<br>
      <br>
      <br style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">
      </span><span
 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; font-weight: bold;">4.&nbsp;
The&nbsp; Opportunity to Commend Kingdom Values<br>
      <br style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">
      </span><span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">The
last reason for being involved is the opportunity it presents to
commend Christian values as contributing in their own right to the
well-being of the general community or polis.&nbsp; The biblical
concept of the Kingdom of God is wider than the concept of the Church
of God.&nbsp; A community in which the Church of God is not only active
when it is gathered, but committed to loving action when it is
dispersed through society &#8211; in workplaces, parliaments, cultural
associations, and neighbourhoods &#8211; is advancing the general influence
of the Kingdom of God and the values at its core. <br>
&nbsp;</span><br style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">
      <span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">As the
heritage argument illustrates, Kingdom values have so infiltrated
social institutions, that even without the direct leadership of
individual Christians, many of these values are now taken for granted,
like the air we breathe.&nbsp; If, now, Christians draw back to protect
their own interests, not only will these values be gradually leached
out, but honourable opportunities for evangelism and social welfare
will be closed off.<br>
      <br style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">
      </span><span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">One&nbsp;
case in point is the state school system.&nbsp; That&#8217;s why from here on
I&#8217;ll be addressing our key question &#8211; &#8220;Which Values Do I Teach in a
Multi-Faith Society?&#8221; &#8211; in the context of seeing what is appropriate
and possible in state schools.&nbsp; But I won&#8217;t be ignoring the fact
that the question is of equal importance, though the variables differ
somewhat, in Christian schools.&nbsp; I occasionally come across
Christian schools which are resolved to keep the pluralism of
Australian society out of their curriculum as much as possible.&nbsp;
At best, any evangelists they produce will be tongue-tied, lacking
understanding or sympathy for where their neighbours are coming from.<br>
      <br style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">
      </span><span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">So
let me tell you about Gary Butcher.&nbsp; Gary is a chaplain in a West
Australian high school.&nbsp; In his limited spare time, he&#8217;s been
developing a curriculum package to help schools become more effective
in the area of values education.<small><small>8</small></small> &nbsp;
He&#8217;s been particularly concerned to offer something more positive than
the typical &#8220;Against Bullying&#8221; approach.&nbsp; He was working on this
well before the Commonwealth funding program came on board, but it
could easily be nested in grant applications in that context.&nbsp;
Currently 27 schools&nbsp; in WA have implemented his program (6 of
them Christian schools, the rest state)and another 18 are looking into
it.<br>
      <br style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">
      </span><span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">Gary&#8217;s
slogan is &#8220;Choose Respect.&#8221;&nbsp; It unpacks this concept as &#8220;respect
is to be treated with care and consideration&#8221;, which actually knits
together at least five of the National Framework&#8217;s Nine Core
Values.&nbsp; And from this Gary derives a clear and practical Code of
Behaviour.&nbsp; The package also provides resources to draw in the
wider community as well as the school.&nbsp; One state school principal
has said that &#8220;the strength of <span style="font-style: italic;">Choose
Respect</span> is that it provides a common language and framework for
students, staff and parents for promoting positive behaviour and
relationships.&#8221;<small><small>9<br>
      </small></small>&nbsp;</span><br
 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">
      <span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">What
particularly appeals to me is that the package comes across as a
non-partisan approach compatible with Australian culture.&nbsp; Another
reason it interests me is that it also reflects a central tradition in
moral philosophy of nominating &#8220;respect for persons&#8221; as the fundamental
principle of ethics, thanks to Immanuel Kant.&nbsp; Mind you, it&#8217;s not
the air you breathe in some other countries!&nbsp; And that&#8217;s because
behind that tradition itself is the Christian heritage. Gary says in an
in-house piece of documentation that his definition &#8220;closely ties
&#8216;Respect&#8217; to the biblical understanding of &#8216;Agape&#8217; love.&#8221;<br>
      <br style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">
      </span><span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">Unlike
some of the other packages I mentioned this morning, which fight shy of
saying up front where they come from, I don&#8217;t think anyone adopting
this package will be unaware that it&#8217;s emerged from a Christian
perspective.&nbsp; But it&#8217;s not &#8220;in your face.&#8221;&nbsp; And it&#8217;s
home-grown.&nbsp; I hope it goes far.<br>
      <br>
      <br style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">
      </span><span
 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; font-weight: bold;">THE
GAP BETWEEN KNOWING AND DOING<br>
      <br style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">
      </span><span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">I&#8217;d
like to say one more thing before getting on to some of the other
values we should be teaching in a multi-faith society.&nbsp; This
morning I used a diagram to illustrate the difference between mere
belief and a personal commitment.&nbsp; I pointed out the gap between
these two stages in the process of acquiring values.&nbsp; The best
education will not be able to guarantee commitment to the values we
teach.&nbsp; Human beings are not puppets, but choosing beings.&nbsp;
That&#8217;s another aspect which Gary Butcher&#8217;s approach highlights.<br>
      <br style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">
      </span><span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">What
I did not go on to say then was that Christians have a particular take
on this difficulty.&nbsp; In regard to moral and religious commitments,
the Scriptures underline this point when they speak on the one hand of
&#8220;believing that certain things are true.&#8221; and on the other hand of
&#8220;believing in Jesus.&#8221;&nbsp; James says scathingly that just saying you
have faith, or believe certain truths, doesn&#8217;t guarantee that you&#8217;ll
act on them.&nbsp; &#8220;Even the devils believe there&#8217;s a God&#8221;, he says,
but &#8220;they tremble in terror&#8221;, because they&#8217;ve chosen not to obey him.<small><small>10</small></small>
&nbsp; And Paul reminds us in Romans 1: 16-17 that human beings have a
tendency to go against their consciences in a rebellious act of
self-assertion.<br>
      <br style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">
      </span><span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">These
insights highlight the need to include teaching about the Christian
perspective on salvation from sin, and therefore the need, if for no
other reason, to back up the teaching of values in the school with the
study of the Christian world-view.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll come back to this point
later.&nbsp; In the meantime, let me offer a definition of values that
I&#8217;ve been using for many years now.&nbsp; It has even crept into one or
two of the National Framework documents!&nbsp; <br>
      <br style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">
      </span><span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">I
say that values are &#8220;the priorities which individuals and societies
attach to certain beliefs, experiences, and objects, in deciding how
they shall live and what they shall treasure.&#8221;&nbsp; This definition
isn&#8217;t confined to moral and religious values only.&nbsp; We set
priorities on many other kinds of belief and experience as well: in the
arts, in sport, in our work-life, and so on.&nbsp; Whichever area we&#8217;re
concerned with, we become <span style="font-weight: bold;">committed</span>
to certain values.&nbsp; <br>
      <br style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">
      </span><span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">So
to link the two concepts together, I say that commitment involves
developing a disposition (a settled tendency) to act upon your
cherished beliefs.&nbsp; Most of all when you commit your way to the
Lord, your beliefs become the source of saving faith, and the gap
between knowing and doing is bridged.<br>
      <br>
      <br style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">
      </span><span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">OTHER VALUES</span><br>
      <br style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">
      </span><span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">But
now let&#8217;s come to other values.&nbsp; I recently drew up for my own
benefit a comparative list of values from various sources, including
the 2004 N.S.W. revision of <span style="font-style: italic;">The
Values We Teach</span>, the traditional seven Catholic virtues, and
some of the packages on the web.&nbsp; No one word occurred on all
lists, though by taking synonyms into account a lot of convergence
could be inferred. <br>
      <br style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">
      </span><span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">Humility,
integrity, justice, respect and responsibility scored well, and love
best of all.&nbsp;&nbsp; Never&not;theless faith, hope, forgiveness,
self-control, sexual purity and truth (as distinct from truthfulness)
barely featured, and reconciliation not at all.<br>
      <br style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">
      </span><span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">Out
of all this, we can see that the 9 Core Values of the National
Framework fare reasonably well, but this list remains rather muddled,
and omits some core Christian values.&nbsp; For example, take the
failure to mention &#8220;truth&#8221;, which one might have thought was crucial to
values education.&nbsp; This is partly because the National list is
primarily about moral values, not educational ones as such.&nbsp; And
the postmodern spirit that&#8217;s abroad discourages confidence in the
possibility of our knowing the truth about anything!&nbsp; It&#8217;s all in
the mind.&nbsp; But Christian epistemology is realist; it affirms a
real world made by the true God.&nbsp; It&#8217;s not a case of &#8220;anything
goes&#8221;, morally or epistemologically.&nbsp; So what are we to make of
all this?&nbsp; At least two imperatives emerge.<br>
      <br>
      <br style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">
      </span><span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Study of World-Views</span><br>
      <br style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">
      </span><span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">One
is the need to study world-views, or people&#8217;s meaning frameworks.&nbsp;
I&#8217;ve already argued the priority of studying the Christian world-view
on educational grounds.&nbsp; But I&#8217;ve also argued that other
world-views which are important to large groups of people in Australian
society ought also to be studied.&nbsp;&nbsp; By the end of their
compulsory education, we need to have given all students a fair
understanding of the main meaning frameworks which contend for
followers in the Australian culture.&nbsp; This involves some teasing
out of the strands of old Christendom, including the spin-off
frame&not;works of Atheism, Marxism, Scientific Humanism, old
Liberalism, post=modeernism, and the Hedonism which several Christian
historians have brought to the fore.<br>
&nbsp; </span><br style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">
      <span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">More
recently, other migrant faiths have begun to impact on us, while
increasing respect is being paid to the indigenous religion which has
actually proved significantly receptive to incoming Christianity.&nbsp;
And none of this denies the prime priority which the teaching of
Christianity should have, in the light of its contribution to the
Australian story, which I mentioned previously.<br>
      <br style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">
      </span><span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">Now
looking at this vast terrain, you&#8217;ll probably decide that I&#8217;ve been
offering you the pipe-dream of an ageing philospher.&nbsp; But if we&#8217;re
thinking of a valid curriculum area, and not just the grudging period a
week some children get that&#8217;s traditionally been called &#8220;Religious
Education&#8221;, then, as I argued in my last book, it should have a share
of the timetable compar&not;able to other key learning areas.&nbsp;
Then there&#8217;d be plenty of room for this agenda.&nbsp; I think it&#8217;s a
goal worth working for &#8211; on educational grounds.&nbsp; Why should the
secularists have all the good lines?<br>
      <br style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">
      </span><span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">I
say again that much of the detail and development of analytic skills
belongs in the later secondary curriculum, but the primary years should
at least acknowledge the various religious and cultural backgrounds of
all children, in a factual and non-judgmental way, as well as majoring
on Christian and other core values.<br>
      <br>
      <br style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">
      </span><span
 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; font-weight: bold;">Negotiated
Value Charters<br>
      <br style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">
      </span><span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">That
brings me to the second imperative.&nbsp; The need for each school to
develop a values charter.&nbsp; It&#8217;s important, for example, that we
resist trends to turn the Nine Core Values into a strait-jacket.&nbsp;
There&#8217;s a hint in the materials produced for the Commonwealth-funded
program that your best chance of getting a grant is to focus your
projects on these nine.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve noticed in the case-study reports,
however, that some schools have bravely expanded their charters to
include other values.&nbsp; And at the national forum there were some
expressions of dissatisfaction with just the nine.&nbsp; I believe we
should keep insisting at every opportunity that this list is only a
starter kit, not a final solution.<br>
      <br style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">
      </span><span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">One
way to do this is to talk up the need for schools to negotiate, in
consultation with their wider communities, robust agreements on the
values for which they want their schools to stand.&nbsp; This is a good
arena for Christians to be active in.&nbsp; The National program on
School-Community Forums gives us a reason to do it, and do it
regularly, irrespective of whether there&#8217;s money in it or not.<br>
      <br style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">
      </span><span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">I
don&#8217;t want to burden this point with detail either, but when I&#8217;ve been
asked to speak about school charters, I&#8217;ve been keen to emphasise that
these should not just be concerned with moral and civic values but
should accommodate consensus agreement on many matters affecting school
life and learning.&nbsp; This is the diagram I use. &nbsp;</span><br>

      </div>
      <span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">Thus,
remembering that we have obligations to broad state and community
values, we should work within this framework to develop clauses which
touch on individual rights, moral and social responsibilities, and
shared values and goals.&nbsp; At the least, what we come up with
should be compatible with liberal democratic, environmentally
responsible, and multicultural values.&nbsp; Then we&#8217;re in a position
to derive educational goals and values.&nbsp; These need to cover
school administrative policies, curriculum objectives, teaching and
assessment procedures, discipline policies, extra-curricular
activities, and community relations.<br>

 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; font-weight: bold;">THE
VOLUNTARY FACTOR AGAIN<br>
      <br style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">
      </span><span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">In
including reference to &#8220;extra-curricular activities&#8221;, I return again to
the &#8220;voluntary factor&#8221; that I discussed this morning.&nbsp; I was
arguing there that the school classroom is an environment heavily
bounded by aspects of compulsion:&nbsp; compulsory attendance,
compulsory curriculum, compulsory assessment, and constraints on
behaviour in the classroom.&nbsp; Therefore, I said, in our approach to
values education, we need to complement schooling strategies with the
provision of freer contexts of learning, and I went on to speak
especially of the value of voluntary groups &#8211; in the community,
including the church; and even in the school itself.<br>
      <br style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">
      </span><span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">But
behind what I said then was a longstanding discomfort with the degree
to which the church has committed itself to the schooling model in its
approach to Christian education.&nbsp; It was therefore a great delight
when a colleague from South Australia sought me out as supervisor of a
doctoral study of the New Testament concept of &#8220;discipling.&#8221;&nbsp;
Sylvia Collinson&#8217;s book <span style="font-style: italic;">Making
Disciples</span> is the result of that work and I strongly recommend it
to you.<br>
&nbsp;</span><br style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">
      <span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">Jesus did
not teach in a school; indeed, the Bible doesn&#8217;t mention the word
school though many existed in New Testament times.&nbsp; But Jesus, by
what an author of a previous generation called a &#8220;transforming
friendship&#8221;<small><small>11</small></small>, turned a small band of
followers into ambassadors to the whole world.&nbsp; They heard him
speak to situations encountered on the road, they saw him practise what
he preached, he sent them out on ministry and debriefed them when they
came back.&nbsp; And each of them knew they were there
voluntarily.&nbsp; They could leave any time &#8211; and one did &#8211; but the
rest were so affirmed by their personal relationship with Jesus that
they crossed the bridge from mere belief to life commitment.&nbsp;
Surely, we pray no less, as values educators, for the boys and girls
who cross our path.<br>

      </small>One of the most probing papers of the Forum was one by
Stephen Judd and Anne Robinson, Christians involved in the delivery of
social services.&nbsp; They argued that in Australia, to a greater
extent than in England, or even the U.S.A., Christian churches had been
responsible for the development of social services.&nbsp; Now, under
the guise of privatisation, many of the safety nets set in place are
being removed.&nbsp; At a political level, there is an element of
hypocrisy in governments saying, on the one hand, that service delivery
is better managed by dedicated voluntary agencies, so grants in aid are
the proper form of government involvement, while on the other hand
over-regulating how they may spend the money, and insisting that if
they want money they must not criticise government policies (see
