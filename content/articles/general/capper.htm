      <h2>USING TECHNOLOGY IN THE CLASSROOM: HOW CHRISTIAN IS THAT?</h2>
<p>The dinner speech at the TCFNSW RUCAS Conference was presented by John
Capper Theological Educator and Consultant. He provided a highly
entertaining and contemporary approach to the subject with excellent
use of PowerPoint. This summary of the main points by John Gore
captures some but not all of the talk.</p>
      
      <p >Technology of
itself does not result in learning. Learning might come from
application of technology.<br>

      <i> Nathan ponders the reality of John Capper&#8217;s beard</i></p>
      <p style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">Some have
argued that placing a computer in the hands of every student would
realise educational outcomes. The fallacy of this argument is shown in
the expectation that world class musicians will automatically result
from placing a piano in every class room.</p>
      <p style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">The world
uses information and communication technologies to reach and to
communicate with as wide an audience as possible. Teachers need to
understand that the use of technology will shape the way we think and
the world we live in.</p>
      <p style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;"><b>Two
Christian Principles</b><br>
      <b>1. Incarnation</b><br>
The entry of Jesus Christ into the world of humans, the Word made
flesh, is a cornerstone of Christian understanding God. This event
represents a turning point in history, beyond human comprehension that
the God of the universe would choose to identify with humans to the
extent of being one of them. That God should choose to be there,
present and in relationship with his creation is the mystery John
speaks about at the beginning of his gospel.</p>
      <p style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">God is there
not technologically but in relationship. As teachers we are also there
in the learning process, present to interact and relate to the learner
in a way that technology never can.</p>
      <p style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">Technology by
itself will not change our lives. It needs to be applied and classrooms
are no exception.</p>

about the words</i></p>
      <p style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;"><b>2.
Relationality</b><br>
God is into relationships, so much so that his very nature is
relational&#8211;Father, Son and Holy Spirit. He relates to his creation and
in particular to humans in his own image. The Bible tells of the
history of this relationship in all its glory and folly.</p>
      <p style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">The world
into which Jesus entered was less technologically advanced than our
world of today. But like our world, technology under the Romans was
changing with increased momentum. Through successive ages God is known
within changing times and culture. He makes himself known and teachers
need to understand the context and world of their students so that they
also can embody the message (the learning) in a particular way that the
computer cannot.</p>
      <p><b style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">Computers
can be only part of a relationship.</b><br
 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">
      <span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;"> Jesus,
the perfection reflection of God, is not the complete picture of the
Trinity. He wants us to know God and not just know about him, to take
the relationship further to learn more about God.</span><br>

      <i style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">Focussing on
the food</i></p>
      <p style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">In the same
way we want to use computers and technology to help students go beyond
our understanding of the curriculum, to enhance learning within
teacher-student relationships.</p>
