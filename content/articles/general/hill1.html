   <h3>IS VALUES EDUCATION JUST THE LATEST FAD?</h3>
      <p>Professor Brian Hill, >M.A., B. Ed., Ph.D., FACE, Emeritus
Professor of Education, formerly Murdoch University, Perth</p>
      <p>Thank you for
inviting me to share some thoughts on the teaching of values.&nbsp;
It&#8217;s certainly flavour of the month, not only in educational circles,
but also in the political arena.&nbsp; Schools, of course, are fair
game when it comes to complaining about anything that&#8217;s not going right
in society.&nbsp; Literacy and numeracy, driver education, graffiti,
drop in our exports &#8211; you name it &#8211; it&#8217;s obvious to everyone that the
school&#8217;s to blame.<br>
      </p>
      <p style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;"><br>
So is current debate about values education another fad?&nbsp; Will the
present high level of funding dry up, or will it be diverted to some
other cause c&eacute;lebre such as the teaching of History, or English,
or Science?&nbsp; I hope not.&nbsp; I suspect not, because this
particular topic has been running now for over 15 years.&nbsp; Why so?<br>
      <br>
      </p>
      <p style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">WHY THE CURRENT INTEREST?<br>
      <br>
      </span>I&#8217;m ancient enough to remember what it was like growing up
in the years after the Second World War.&nbsp; The general community
was staidly mono-cultural, accepting the values of Christendom &#8211; even
if they didn&#8217;t live by them.&nbsp; Mind you, not all the values of
Christendom were Christian.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve never been a Christian country,
only one strongly influenced by core Christian values.<br>
      </p>
      <p style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">I suppose
that&#8217;s what made people think that state schools could be
value-neutral. The values of Christendom were being taken for granted,
like the air we breathe.&nbsp; When I became a university lecturer in
the mid-&#8216;sixties, I chose to focus my research on the application of
ethics and value theory in education.&nbsp; I might as well have chosen
underwater flower arrangement, for all the interest people had in what
I was working on.&nbsp; State schools were expected to be value-neutral
and just teach facts and skills.&nbsp; And church schools felt they
knew what the core values were, and how to teach them, so they didn&#8217;t
need anyone suggesting they ought to think again about the teaching of
values.</p>
      <p style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">But even
then, a number of factors were breaking down the general consensus in
Australian society.&nbsp; In my university studies, Scientific
Positivism was banishing religion to the cultural graveyard;&nbsp;
Western societies in the &#8216;sixties were experiencing a youth revolution
which was challenging adult authority;&nbsp; the contraceptive pill was
tempting many people to relax their sexual standards, and migration was
bringing to our shores many people who held different world-views from
ours.&nbsp; Some worrying outcomes of all this have been steep
increases in the number of broken marriages, dysfunctional families,
and ethnic disagreements.&nbsp; <br>
      </p>
      <p style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
PACE QUICKENING IN THE &#8216;NINETIES<br>
      <br>
      </span>It took a while for the community to admit it had
problems, but then in the &#8216;nineties, there was an increasing number of
public enquiries into values education.&nbsp; Let me name some of the
most notable &#8211; it&#8217;s an incomplete list, but it makes the point.&nbsp; <br>
      </p>
      <p style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">In 1991, for
example, the Director-General of Education in NSW, an Evangelical
Christian named Dr Fenton Sharpe, issued a very robust revision of an
official Education Department statement called The Values We
Teach.&nbsp; Three years later a Queensland Report on Education
included a values charter for State schools.&nbsp; In 1995, I was
involved with others in a West Australian project in the non-state
sector which developed an Agreed Minimum Values Frame&not;work.&nbsp;
Shortly after, the Minister for Education set up the West Australian
Curriculum Council, which produced a Curriculum Framework for all
subjects including, for the first time, a Values Framework heavily
indebted our earlier production.</p>
      <p style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Enter the Commonwealth<br>
      <br>
      </span>In the meantime, the Commonwealth Government was
stirring.&nbsp; After the publication of the national Dawkins
curriculum, which had been woefully lacking in attention to values
out&not;comes, a different government department began to push a
different line.&nbsp; In 1994, the Prime Minister&#8217;s Department
published a report on Civics and Citizenship which pushed for direct
values education in these areas.&nbsp; Before the Government could act
on this report, however, the Liberal Party won the next election and it
went on hold.&nbsp; But for once an incoming Govern&not;ment didn&#8217;t
undo a previous policy.&nbsp; Instead, as follow-up to the Citizenship
Report, it launched the Discovering Democracy project.&nbsp; This ran
from 1996, and there are some very useful resources on its website.</p>
      <p style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">Then, in
2002, the Education Minister of the time, Brendan Nelson, funded a
Values Education Study, which involved 69 schools, chosen across state
and sectoral boundaries.&nbsp; Some good things happened in several of
these schools, and Nelson decided to bid in cabinet for more
money.&nbsp; The 2004 Federal Budget set aside a sum of $29.7 million
for a 4-year Values Education Program, including the following elements:<br>
      <br>
&#8226; A poster spelling out &#8220;9 Core Values&#8221;&nbsp; and a booklet describing
the&nbsp; National Frame&not;work in detail.<br>
&#8226; School Forums -&nbsp; Each Australian school is entitled to make a
one-off bid for $1000 to conduct a school and community
forum.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
&#8226; The Good Practice Schools Project &#8211; In the first round, there were
grants to 26 clusters involving 132 schools&nbsp; (32 non-state, mainly
Catholic - the rest, state schools)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
&#8226; University Associate Network&nbsp; - one academic advisor was
assigned to each cluster.<br>
&#8226; National Education Forums were to be conducted annually where there
would be reports from the field on what was happening &#8211; this year&#8217;s
forum was held last May. <br>
&#8226; Curriculum and Community Resources pitched at Primary, Secondary, and
Community levels.<br>
&#8226; A national website&nbsp; on which all publications are available.</p>
      <p style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">What&#8217;s currently happening?<br>
      <br>
      </span>So what&#8217;s currently happening, if anything?&nbsp; It&#8217;s a
natural question to ask, because fads can often be a lot of sound and
fury signifying nothing.&nbsp; I for one was apprehensive, that when
all this grant money was made available, the end result might be a lot
of window dressing and travel to talk-fests, without anything much
changing on the ground.</p>
      <p style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">But in last
May&#8217;s Forum, reports came in from the various parts of the federal
program, particularly the school clusters in the Good Practice Schools
Project.&nbsp; And I found myself feeling excited about the number of
schools and teachers that were really trying to make a
difference.&nbsp; Many experiments were being tried, and many keen
people were involved. Since then, a second round of Commonwealth grants
has been set in motion.</p>
      <p style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">The school
forum program hadn&#8217;t gone very far at that stage, but that was because
promised resources had been slow in coming, and in fact these only went
onto the website after the conference.&nbsp; Meanwhile, several states
had begun to foreground values education even before the Commonwealth
program began.&nbsp; In NSW, for instance, John Gore has been leading
the charge, and you probably know better than I what is being
achieved.&nbsp; So I won&#8217;t dwell on the plus side any more.&nbsp; I
think it equally important, however, to identify some shortcomings that
are evident in current approaches.</p>
      <p style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;"><br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">SOME SHORTCOMINGS IN PRESENT
EFFORTS<br>
      <br>
1.&nbsp; Confused Discourse<br>
      <br>
      </span>The first shortcoming, as I see it, is that we&#8217;re not used
to talking technically about beliefs and values.&nbsp; These are words
with a good feel.&nbsp; They add colour to many speech nights and
school brochures.&nbsp; But they tend to conceal some of the
difficulties which in practice tempt teachers to put them in the too
hard basket.&nbsp; After all, talking about &#8220;facts&#8221; and &#8220;skills&#8221; and
&#8220;cognitive outcomes&#8221; sounds satisfactorily hard-nosed and translatable
into strategies of teaching and assessment.&nbsp; But beliefs and
values?&nbsp; Are they the same thing?&nbsp; Can they be
measured?&nbsp; Indeed, ought they to be measured?</p>
      <p style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">As a first
step in developing ethical discourse I often begin by offering a
clarification of the relation between these two terms.&nbsp; The
teacher presents an idea which Ernie encounters for the first
time.&nbsp; He can reproduce what he heard in a written test, but
that&#8217;s not necessarily the same thing as understanding it.&nbsp; So
teachers know that relying on rote learning won&#8217;t get us far.&nbsp; We
must teach, and test, for understanding.&nbsp; But now here&#8217;s another
complication.&nbsp; Will that be enough to guarantee that Ernie will
believe what we tell him?</p>
      <p style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">Belief is a
further step, obliging Ernie to decide whether the idea fits in with
his general view of the world.&nbsp; He may of course believe that
everything the teacher says is infallibly true.&nbsp; But no good
teacher could be content to leave it there.&nbsp; We must help Ernie to
review the evidence for and against that idea being true, requiring him
to think for himself.&nbsp; But now, supposing Ernie comes to believe
that the idea in question is true, can we be confident that he will
value it, to the extent of thinking it important enough to influence
his choices in life?&nbsp; That seems to require something more.</p>
      <p style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">I can say
that I have grounds for believing that the Sydney Swans are not gentle
birds but actually a group of AFL footballers, even if they don&#8217;t seem
to fly very high. But I also have to say, though with some diffidence
in present company, that I don&#8217;t attach much value to that piece of
information.&nbsp; In fairness, the Fremantle Dockers don&#8217;t quicken my
pulse much either.&nbsp; By contrast, I also believe that many people
in Third World countries experience appalling poverty, and this prompts
me to channel some of my personal resources to them through what I
believe to be a faithful and well-managed aid agency.&nbsp; My belief
in this case has provoked me to act in accordance with the value I
place on the worth of other human beings.</p>
      <p style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">And for
teachers, there&#8217;s the rub.&nbsp; Telling students something, and even
implanting a belief, don&#8217;t guarantee that our students will embrace
values that we consider worthy.&nbsp; For that we need a richer account
of how we teach values, and a rcognition of the limitations of
schooling at this point. This takes us on to the second shortcoming.</p>
      <p style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;"><br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">2.&nbsp; Simplistic Psychology<br>
      <br>
      </span>It&#8217;s been heartening to see the number of cluster school
reports which have taken into account the often hidden curriculum of
schooling.&nbsp; Some mention the importance of teachers as models,
recognising that teachers inevitably reflect their personal values in
their attitudes to the students both as learners and as persons.&nbsp;
That&#8217;s an important point, often honoured in the breach by teachers who
see themselves merely as instructors, na&iuml;vely imagining that the
students are unaware of their core values.</p>
      <p style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">The same goes
for school principals, of course, particularly in relation to the way
they run their school and behave towards their staff and
students.&nbsp; I recall the principal who announced to his staff,
&#8220;This term all classes will devote six periods to teaching the concept
of democracy.&nbsp; I want your programs on my desk by Friday.&nbsp;
That will be all!&#8221;&nbsp; The situation is not much better in schools
that teach values like &#8220;honesty&#8221; and &#8220;resilience&#8221; in two weeks blocs
and expect lasting attachment to occur.</p>
      <p style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">There are
also disturbing blind-spots in the approaches of those favouring
cognitive psychology and those favouring behaviourist approaches.&nbsp;
The cognitivists are likely to heed our earlier warning that
transmission of values by telling isn&#8217;t enough.&nbsp; They rightly
emphasise that we must encourage value analysis and critical thinking
as well.&nbsp; But they don&#8217;t necessarily recognise the gap between
believing and valuing.&nbsp; Behaviourists, on the other hand, may put
their trust in reinforcing desirable behaviours and punishing bad
behaviours, unaware that the conformity they are able to secure in the
classroom may not extend beyond it.</p>
      <p style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">Human beings
are choosing beings, however young, with an inner core of selfhood
which either rises up in rebellion or fakes consent until free from the
authority figures which are controlling them.&nbsp; This ought also to
warn us against attributing too much power to the schooling model to
achieve all we hope for in the area of values education.</p>
      <p style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;"><br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">3.&nbsp; The Limitations of
Reliance on Lists<br>
      <br>
      </span>The second issue concerns the limitations of relying on
mere lists of values, taught seriatim.&nbsp; Many lists of recommended
core values are being touted.&nbsp; They give the impression that
values are a bit like walnuts lying on the ground.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a game of
mix and match.&nbsp; Pick the ones you like:&nbsp; &#8220;I&#8217;ll have honesty,
but I think I&#8217;ll let you have chastity ...&#8221;, and so on.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Various curriculum packages can now be located on the Net.</p>
      <p style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">One package
is called &#8220;Living Values Education.&#8221;&nbsp;&nbsp; It lists 12 core
values.&nbsp; Another, called &#8220;The Virtues Project&#8221; nominates 52.&nbsp;
Catholic theology spells out the traditional 7: 4 natural virtues, 3
theological.&nbsp; A Jewish rabbi wrote to me recently arguing for what
are termed the Noahide Laws &#8211; ie. seven commandments which the Bible
says God gave Noah.&nbsp; Many Jewish writers say these constitute a
universal ethic binding on all human beings.&nbsp; All this is rather
confusing for curriculum developers and busy teachers.&nbsp; <br>
      </p>
      <p style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">All the same,
I&#8217;d like to put in a good word for the Commonwealth attempt to identify
9 core values.&nbsp; I think the list&#8217;s a bit muddled, but at least
it&#8217;s an attempt to tie them in with Australia&#8217;s commitment to
democracy.&nbsp; That&#8217;s a step on the way to acknowledging that values
need justification.&nbsp; Good walnuts don&#8217;t come from nowhere; they
grow on trees.</p>
      <p style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">People need
to feel that good reasons lie behind the values they live by.&nbsp;
They need to connect with the deeper beliefs people have about why
they&#8217;re here and what gives their lives significance.&nbsp; That&#8217;s the
problem of justification.&nbsp; At the same time, if people feel
certain values are right for them, then that also provides the
motivation to live by them.&nbsp; It all depends on your world
view.&nbsp; That brings me to the fourth shortcoming.</p>
      <p style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;"><br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">4.&nbsp; The Neglect of
World-view Studies<br>
      <br>
      </span>If we&#8217;re going to teach values properly, somewhere along
the line we need to study the way world-views cause people to act the
way they do.&nbsp; Just learning about a number of values that some
people regard as core values will fall to the ground.&nbsp; It may even
mislead students because, in the end, no recommended package is
world-view neutral.&nbsp; I mentioned, for example, that Catholic and
Jewish world-views each present core values in a different way because
of their total views of the world.&nbsp; Walnuts grow on trees.&nbsp;
What about the other lists I mentioned?</p>
      <p style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">Take &#8220;Living
Values Education&#8221; &#8211; the package that lists 12 core values.&nbsp; Where
has it come from?&nbsp; The answer is a Hindu group called Brahma
Kumaris.&nbsp; The fact that their package has been promoted by UNESCO
in over 70 countries shouldn&#8217;t blind us to the influence of Hindu
philosophy on the selection and description of these values.&nbsp; Or
take &#8220;The Virtues Project&#8221;, which listed 52 values.&nbsp; Where has
that come from?&nbsp; It took rather more detective work on the Net to
track down the fact that it originates from a Ba&#8217;hai source.&nbsp; Once
you know that, you can detect a slant in the way the values are
unpacked and presented.</p>
      <p style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">Now both
these packages are well-constructed.&nbsp; Most of their resources can
be put to good use, because many of the values they recommend are
common also to the cultural heritage of Australia.&nbsp; But older
students particularly would need to be made aware of their origins, and
taught about how to evaluate world-views &#8211; not just the one they know
most about already, but others which are having a big effect in our
society.&nbsp; I might say that I find it rather ironical that these
packages should be gaining such ready acceptance in schools, while at
the same time study of the Christian world-view and the values it has
contributed to public life and culture in Australia is being
increasingly contested. <br>
      <br>
It&#8217;s worth mentioning in this connection that a conference was recently
held in Canberra chal&not;lenging the neglect, in the teaching of
Australian history, of the substantial influence of Christian beliefs
and values.&nbsp; Some of the excellent papers presented there by noted
academics and politicians are&nbsp; now available on the website of the
Australia&#8217;s Christian Heritage National Forum -&nbsp; that&#8217;s
&lt;http://australiaschristianheritageforum.org.au/resources&gt;</p>
      <p style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;"><br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">ESSENTIAL PARTNERSHIPS<br>
      <br>
      </span>The last set of issues I want to raise concerns the need
for effective partnerships in the total project of values
education.&nbsp;&nbsp; It&#8217;s common to hear people saying piously that
in this matter the school needs to co-operate with the home, and vice
versa.&nbsp; But if we&#8217;re going to get beyond comforting platitudes,
more must be said about this aspect.</p>
      <p style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">I&#8217;ve
commented in passing a few times already on the fact that the school is
limited in what it <br>
      </p>
      <p
 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; text-align: center;"><img
 src="/images/Pyramid.jpg" title="" alt="Agents in Values Education"
 style="height: 249px; width: 377px;"><br>
      </p>
      <p style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;"><br>
can do.&nbsp; That runs counter to the attitude of some teachers who
consider that parents are amateurs whose influence on their children
must be countered in the interests of a good education.&nbsp; This
professional snobbery is not exclusive to teachers.&nbsp; And it
receives some backing from statistics which show alarming increases in
the number of dysfunctional families.<br>
      <br>
But there are also other agencies that are influencing the young, and
need to be taken into account.&nbsp; The diagram above indicates
particular contributions that are made respectively by the home, the
school and voluntary groups.&nbsp; In principle, these may be regarded
as benevolent influences, whereas the influence of the mass media is
much more ambivalent, especially when we factor in the dominance of the
profit motive, which encouragers programmers to exploit human frailties
in the interests of keeping their attention and encouraging them to
consume products.&nbsp;&nbsp; At the least, education in media analysis
and resistance is an essential part of values education.<br>
      </p>
      <p style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">I haven&#8217;t
time to explore other details in this diagram, but one thing it is
meant to illustrate is that the home cannot be disregarded, and the
school that declines to cultivate this partnership will find its
efforts in values education thwarted by the generally stronger effect
of home values.&nbsp; This has implications for parent education,
particularly in a time when parenting skills are no longer passed on in
many dysfunctional households.&nbsp; The same is true of the school&#8217;s
partnership with worthy voluntary groups, and I&#8217;d like to fill that
aspect out a little more just before I close.</p>
      <p style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;"><br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Partnership with voluntary
agencies</span></p>
      <p style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">I often
invite people to consider a continuum extending from institutions
characterised by controls and compulsion, to those characterised by
freedom of choice and action.&nbsp; Then I invite them to nominate an
institution nearest to the compulsory end.&nbsp; What would you
nominate?&nbsp; <br>
      </p>
      <p style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">Surely, a
prison.&nbsp; But ever since Erving Goffman spelled out the defining
features of &#8220;asylums&#8221; or psychiatric hospitals in the 1960s , we&#8217;ve
become more aware how often the &#8220;cells and bells&#8221; pattern of control
emerges in other institutions &#8211; as, for example, the boarding school,
and to a lesser degree, the day school.&nbsp; I was reminded how often
we fall back on control techniques when they&#8217;re actually
counter-productive in terms of the outcomes we hope for, when I looked
into the way long summer camps for teenagers are set up in the
U.S.A..&nbsp; Some constraints are necessary in such a residential
environment as a camp, and teachers are good at suggesting and applying
them.&nbsp; But the best camp leaders are those who try to minimise the
role boundaries of leadership and build personal bonds through free
association.</p>
      <p style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">This is even
truer of the voluntary group where attendance is entirely at the
discretion of the young person.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll spell its features out more
in a moment.&nbsp; The ultimate position on the continuum, going in
this direction, is the personal friendship, where roles have been
superseded by relationships, and influence replaces control as the
lever in the adoption of values.<br>
But where would you locate the home on this continuum?&nbsp; Homes
differ greatly, and clearly there must be elements of compulsion in the
earlier years, but good parents strive over time to increase the areas
of free association available to the child, and in the best families
hope for personal friendship.</p>
      <p style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">What about
churches?&nbsp; They operate, after all, in the voluntary sector of our
kind of society.&nbsp; There are some religious groups which rely
heavily on psychological pressure to secure conformity and loyalty in
the young (and older!), but in their all-age activities there will be
some mimicking of the gradual release of control which characterises
good homes.&nbsp; And, of course, churches have been well aware in
recent centuries of the compatibility of voluntary youth groups with
the objectives they are trying to reach.</p>
      <p style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">Finally, I
return to my earlier comments about the limitations of schooling in
respect of values education.&nbsp; Voluntary groups and the school need
each other, particularly in dealing with the education of
adolescents.&nbsp; Each has a role, and each, hopefully, appreciates
the value of cultiv&not;ating a personal relationship.&nbsp; By
contract, the teacher is necessarily more directly obliged to play a
role in controlling the class, presenting a curriculum, and assessing
the outcomes of learning.&nbsp; The youth leader, on the other hand &#8211;
less endowed than the teacher with powers of compulsion &#8211; is more able
to present as a friendly person in free association with whoever
chooses to associate with his or her group.</p>
      <p style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">The strengths
of schooling include being able to reach the entire population of
children and youth, offering them access to reliable public
information, equipping them with the skills needed to evaluate
different beliefs and values, and the social competencies needed to
operate wisely and well in pluralistic democracy.&nbsp; The down-side
is that compulsory attendance, necessary limitations on free movement,
and compulsory curriculum and assessment, all tend to constrain
students and generate resistance in them to the inculcation of values.</p>
      <p style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">On the other
side of the ledger, the down-side of leadership in a voluntary group is
that only those who want to come are brought under the group&#8217;s
influence, there are risks that groups representing a particular
world-view may give biased information, and create a ghetto
mentality.&nbsp; As to what you can do if things are getting out of
control, your final recourse is to exclude the young person from the
group, which of course defeats your purpose in setting the goup up.<br>
On the other hand, voluntary groups affirm the choosing person.&nbsp;
They gain dignity from being free to inspect what you have to offer, to
enter freely into closer association with the group and with adult
friends, and to &#8220;try on&#8221; the values you are commending to them by word,
action, and personal example.</p>
      <p style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">Good schools
will not look down on community groups or regard their programs as
being in competition with the school&#8217;s activities.&nbsp; They will
commend reputable community groups to their students as a way of
extending their own curriculum in liberal studies, sport, religious and
cultural pursuits, and community service.&nbsp; Even during school time
itself, they will be hospitable to voluntary student activities on the
premises, and elective subjects, as opposed to investing all the hours
available in compulsory curriculum.</p>
      <p style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">In
particular, we may reasonably hope that when it sometimes seems
impossible to negotiate with dysfunctional parents and carers, the
symbiosis between school and voluntary groups may yet rehabilitate
damaged youngsters, and inspire in all students a commitment to serving
others.&nbsp; That will be the point at which to assess how much or
little we&#8217;ve achieved in values education. <br>
