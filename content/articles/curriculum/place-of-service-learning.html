          <h2>Breaking the mould: Is there a place for service learning in the revised NSW curriculum?</h2>
         <h3> Introduction</h3>
<p>The current revision of the NSW curriculum has received various inputs and included a
reference to the community involvement possibly like the project modules available within
the International Baccalaureate (IB). In NSW, attempts to introduce students to learning
involving both group and individual projects is not new. Even within HSC courses there are
personal interest projects and major works which are externally assessed as well as projects
that form assessment tasks in other subjects like Business Studies. But most of these are
individual and not group tasks.</p>
<p>One of the attractions of the IB is that students will learn from individual and group projects
that involve an element of community service or engagement. Is that where the curriculum
review is heading? As Christian educators, with a concern for others and a servant attitude,
    service learning is of particular interest.</p>

          <h3>Service learning</h3>
<p>Most commonly, schools, more in the non-government sector, have sought to capitalise on the
social benefits of service learning to provide students with a community-oriented approach to
life where serving others is seen as a priority. It could involve charity work, working with a
service organisation or community volunteers. Some schools have added a service learning
component to excursions, especially when students travel overseas. By working in another
community, students learn about that community and develop relationships with the people.
    Students may develop a sense of personal fulfilment and individual worth by helping others.</p>
    <p>
For others, service learning is to use community work to reconnect socially alienated students
to other people and communities so they are more likely to value learning and see purpose in
        their schooling.</p>
<p>As programs in both primary and secondary schools have expanded, service learning has taken
on its own pedagogy and methodologies with statements like: students are engaged in tasks
that stretch them cognitively and developmentally; student voice is maximised in selecting,
designing, implementing and evaluating the service project; student reflection takes place
before, during and after service that include higher order thinking skills such as analysis,
evaluation and/or problem solving as a way to understand the service activity. (Billig 2000)
As a result, schools have increasingly looked to include elements of service learning to
achieve curriculum outcomes within the disciplines. However, impediments such as the
amount of content to be covered and the time needed for service learning, have led to it
being viewed as a less efficient way in achieving curriculum outcomes. The key question is
whether service learning is valued enough to see the curriculum modified to facilitate such
learning. Can service learning deliver in the values (affective domain) better than traditional
subjects? Do we want to reduce students’ screen time and give more time to them engaging
    the community in which they live?</p>
          <h3>Service learning and social justice</h3>
<p>One of the forces promoting service learning is a desire for social justice. In service learning,
students become increasingly aware of others, their circumstances and the factors leading to
social privilege and disadvantage. But here is where the whole direction becomes a bit messy
as evidenced by Jones (2019), working with US Christian college students, who argues that in
service learning social justice learning goes through four stages and that knowledge of these
stages is needed by teachers to help students achieve this learning. Teachers are to assist
students to move from one stage to the next. Knowing about others is different from knowing
them. Knowing about their circumstances is different to experiencing them. Developing
patriarchal and emphatic relationships is different to reciprocal connections. Recognising
privilege and disadvantage is different from understanding and associating with cultural,
          political and religious issues.</p>
<p>Using a scale adapted from St Cloud University Campus and Deleuzian affect theory, Jones
        illustrates these stages for a white college in a USA context. His stages are:<br>
Initial stage – Clarity<br>
Emerging stage – Caring<br>
Distance stage – Ataraxia (reflection)<br>
Developing stage – social justice.</p>

          <h3>An example</h3>
<p>In the Australian context let me consider how this framework might apply in developing my
critical consciousness through service learning in relation to my work over seven years in
    India.</p>
<p><strong>Stage 1 Charity</strong><br> My service orientation was to do for others, to help achieve a school system
that would raise the educational standards of Dalit (lowest socioeconomic group) Indian
students in 100 English medium schools. I had to demonstrate my expertise and establish
credibility – I had to “do”. I didn’t see race as an issue and believed the very poor children we
were working for were less fortunate and disadvantaged. I believed that India wanted to help
these people.<br>
<strong>Stage 2 Caring </strong><br>I learnt to work more with others and include them in the work and recognise
their gifts. I came to understand different races, castes and my attitudes to them. I began to
understand the complexities of Indian society, politics and religions. Then I realised that
anyone of these children could be my son (adopted from India) or for that matter me by
chance of parent.<br>
<strong>Stage 3 Ataraxia </strong><br>I began to reflect on my role and train others in the work and “do” less. I
listened to the histories of people from different castes, religions and backgrounds. I
understood how colonial, English (white) privilege has further entrenched injustices in India
and how I as a westerner might be contributing to maintaining many of these injustices.<br>
<strong>Stage 4 Social justice</strong><br> I had learnt to work with others and to not be seen as an educational
guru. My acceptance of others was stronger and I wanted to work for, and with those, seeking
to change the social structures and systemic problems, especially caste, that are inherent
throughout almost all Indian society and working against social justice.<br>
There are implications here for service learning and how it might be incorporated into the
NSW curriculum either directly or through some form of project requirement. The focus
should be on progress from whichever stage a student starts at, not on Stage 4 achievement
    for all.</p>
<h3>Curriculum examples of service learning using the Jones Framework</h3>
<p>Two possible contexts for service learning in Australian schools attracted my interest –
    community service to the aged and a service component in an overseas excursion.</p>
<strong>Example 1. Community service to the aged</strong>
Students and teacher decide that for a service learning project, the students will visit a
nursing home on a regular basis and provide a range of services to participating residents
including: listening to their stories, reading to them, helping them with simple tasks like
finding things, shopping and communicating with others.<p>
<p><strong>At Stage 1 Charity.</strong> Students will do for others; they learn by helping others; they see
everyone as the same or everyone as different; they view residents as disadvantaged and be
unaware of self in this situation.</p>
<p><strong>At Stage 2 Caring.</strong> Students interact with and work with residents to assist them meet their
needs; they recognise that they are receiving something back from their relationship with
older people; their view of the other changes – this could be one of my parents or even me;
they recognise the need for government regulation to ensure basic rights and recognise that
    the world is more complex.</p>
<p><strong>At Stage 3 Ataraxia. </strong> Students do less and empower residents to do more for themselves; they
internalise residents’ personal histories and reflect on how, for some, their situation is an
outcome of other people’s privilege; they stand back and evaluate the impact they are having
    in the lives of the residents and whether it is helping or propping up injustice.</p>
          <p><strong>Stage 4 Social justice.</strong> Students work together with residents unlearning their fears and
prejudices about older people; they recognise that these residents are equals with them and
they want to lobby for better conditions and support for residential care while understanding
              the social and political structures and systems that determine this situation of aged care.</p>
<h3>Example 2 Service component in an overseas excursion</h3>
<p>Students sign up for an overseas excursion that involves helping an orphanage in an Asian
    country over a period of one week.</p>
<p><strong>Stage 1 Charity. </strong>Students do for others - providing gifts, entertainment and activities for the
children; they are unaware of racial difference and see these children as less fortunate,
    educationally backward and socially disadvantaged.</p>
<p><strong>Stage 2 Caring.</strong> Students interact with the children and learn some words in their language;
they see the children as racially and culturally different and understand that in other
circumstances these children could be them; they understand that the world and the
children’s backgrounds are bigger and more complex than they thought and recognise some
    aspects of racial prejudice and cultural superiority within themselves.</p>
<p><strong>Stage 3 Ataraxia. </strong>Students spend more time with the children listening to and internalising
their histories and current circumstances; they reflect on how their western heritage, local
privilege and social injustice have affected the children’s situation; they become less certain
about the positive impact of their visit and question what long term benefits might come
    about.</p>
<p><strong>Stage 4 Social justice.</strong> Students learn to work with the children as equals for the common
good respecting their input and talents; they reflect critically on privilege and how injustice
comes from multifaceted interactions between culture, politics and disadvantage globally;
they begin to unlearn internalised prejudice and racism and become an ally of systemic
    change that challenges the status quo.</p>
<p>When viewed through this lens of social justice conscientiousness, service learning could be a
powerful tool in assisting students at every level to confront these issues. One of the key
insights that affected my thinking was - are my actions assisting or working against the
interests of the target group? The Ataraxia stage was a real eyeopener. I also reflected on my
experience of orphanages in India and Cambodia where many of the children were not
orphans but handed over by poor parents to ensure that living costs and some education were
at someone else’s expense – the foreign donors. Some of these orphanages were poorly
    managed and how funds were used became of increasing concern.</p>
<h3>Christian concerns</h3>
<p>Christians are going to be attracted to service learning because serving others is a basic
element of what it means to be a Christian. In a selfish world focused on wealth accumulation
and the rights of the individual, many have lamented the loss of community within our
suburbs leading to loneliness for older people and alienation for younger people. It’s probably
the most radical of Jesus teaching, the parable of the good Samaritan, that establishes a
rationale for service learning for Christians. However, intent is not enough, service learning
requires action and here the Christian acts out of thankfulness to God for everything that has
been done in Christ. Service to others holds particular attraction for Christians but is not
    without its problems.</p>
<p>Jones’ framework provides a model for incorporation into any program of service learning
because it goes beyond only providing a service to the heart of social consciousness of the
students and how social justice might be achieved. It helps students to question their actions,
to face their privilege and understand their part (possibly contribution) in the injustices they
    are attempting to address.</p>
<p>The teaching emphasis is on movement to the next stage. Students at each stage are
respected and helped to move to the next stage. This is a powerful model and one that can
be life changing. For Christians it can mould their world-view to focus more effectively on
    mission.</p>
