          <h2>Religious Schools and LGBT discrimination</h2>
         
<p>In the lead up to Christmas 2018, the media became obsessed with the rights of LGBT
students and teachers including the expulsion and exclusion of LGBT students and dismissal
and non-employment of LGBT teachers. These concerns came from three sources:
    <ol>
<li>The leaked text and recommendations from the Ruddock Religious Freedom Review
retaining existing exemptions for religious schools.</li>
<li>The defence of the NO vote on same sex marriage by religious groups and their
reaction to the success of the YES vote.</li>
<li>A letter from a group of Anglican school principals widely interpreted as anti LGBT.
      </li>  </ol>
<h3>The Ruddock Review</h3>
<p>The Ruddock Review came about because of increasing concern amongst religious groups that
growing antireligious secularism is eroding the freedom of religion rights currently enjoyed
under Australian law. There was always going to be tension between those wanting to
maintain existing provisions and those wanting change.</p>
<p>When completed, the Review was presented to the Australian Government and then sections
leaked to the press and without knowing all the recommendations and associated discussion,
some of the more contentious parts were highlighted in the media. The focus quickly became
the maintenance of existing provisions within the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 that allow
religious schools to exclude or expel students and to dismiss or refuse employment based on
sexual orientation. The community outcry was focused on religious schools discriminating on
the basis of sexual orientation and that such discrimination violated basic human rights.</p>
<p>The key point is in Recommendations 5 and 7 which allows this discrimination <i>on the basis of
sexual orientation, gender identity or relationship status provided that, among other things:
    The discrimination is founded in the precepts of the religion.</i> (More about this shortly.)</p>
<p>The Prime Minister, in his press conference, emphasized that these provisions already existed
and that the Government would consider the Review in due course, but had no intention to
change existing law. Unfortunately, this added fuel to the antireligious fires being lit under
the review and caused general community concern that such provisions promoted homophobia
leading to discrimination against LGBT students and teachers.</p>
<h3>The YES vote</h3>
<p>The discussion of the Ruddock Review occurred just after the YES vote for same sex marriage.
The conservatives and most religious groups had hoped that the NO case would win the day
but increasingly in the lead up to the vote, polls showed that the YES vote would win. Sydney
Anglicans became so concerned about this that the Archbishop agreed to contribute one
million dollars to the NO vote. This was not supported by all Anglicans, some believing that
these funds could be better allocated to the spread of the Gospel or the support of those in
need. Nor did many Christians like the content, tone and innuendo of the NO vote
advertisements. These, and other NO case actions, took their toll on the community
reinforcing negativity towards religious groups and it partly explains why the Ruddock Review
recommendations had so much negative traction in the community. Having removed marriage
discrimination, secular interests were not about to have religious discrimination in schools
promoted.</p>
          <h3>Anglican school principals’ letter</h3>
<p>While it was well intended to support the rights of religious schools to have enrolment and
employment freedom and not to be subject to secular dictates that cut across their core
values and beliefs, this letter was widely viewed as an endorsement of discrimination allowing
exclusion or expulsion of students and dismissal and non employment of LGBT people.</p>
<p>Some Anglican principals did not sign the letter and after substantial protest from school
alumni, other principals backtracked when they understood how the letter was being read
and interpreted. In response the Anglican Archbishop said <i>Let’s be very clear. Anglican
schools in Sydney do not expel students for being gay. It is an absurd proposition and it is
certainly not something we asked for in our submission to the Ruddock Review. We would
gladly support any amendment to the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 which would clarify
    this.</i> (SMH 15/10/18) While this statement settled the fears of many regarding Anglican
students, the Archbishop does not speak for other religious schools and left the matter of
teachers open by saying <i>Anglican schools, if they are going to remain Anglican, must be able
to employ staff who support the Christian values of the school. (More about this too shortly.)
The letter from the principals said while schools would not expel gay students or staff in
practice, they wanted to preserve the right to employ people who "support the ethos of the
    school.</i> (SMH 2/11/18)</p>
<p>So, we wait for the Government to consider the review and possibly enact legislation, but
given the controversy that might arise, it would be a brave person to predict any action
before the next election.</p>
          <h3>“Precepts of religion”</h3>
<p>The Sex Discrimination Act 1984 allows for schools to discrimination <i>on the basis of sexual
orientation, gender identity or relationship status provided that: The discrimination is
    founded in the precepts of the religion.</i></p>
<p>Precepts are general rules intended to regulate behaviour or thought. Its synonyms are:
principle, rule, tenet, canon, code, doctrine, guideline. (Various dictionaries). In this regard,
what precepts would a school claim to discriminate against a person on the basis of sexual
orientation, gender identity or relationship status? Focusing on Christianity, what are the
precepts we operate from: <i>Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul
and with all your mind and with all your strength.’ 31 The second is this: ‘Love your
    neighbour as yourself.’ There is no commandment greater than these.</i> (Mark 12:30-31)</p>
<p>Jesus explained who our neighbour is in the parable of the Good Samaritan, Paul outlines the
quality of this love in 1Corinthians 13 and Jesus demonstrates its fullness in his sacrificial
death on the cross. What precepts would a school wish to call upon to discriminate on the
basis of sexual orientation, gender identity or relational status?</p>
<p>But it is not this simple. There may be lifestyles that justify discrimination and exclusion from
teaching – paedophilia, promiscuity, illicit drug dealing, criminal convictions for violence or
sexual assault. However, these exclusions apply across the whole community to people of
every sexual orientation, gender identity and relationship status. As in government schools,
not anyone can be a teacher and discrimination is required to maintain teacher quality. The
key issue here is, what might Christian schools claim in additional to other types of schools as
precepts and should these be protected as is currently the case with the Sex Discrimination
Act or by new legislation protecting or providing for wider religious freedom?</p>
          <h3>“The Christian values of the school”</h3>
          <h4>Teachers</h4>
<p>A number of Christians, including the Anglican archbishop, have argued that Christian schools
must be able to employ teachers who support the Christian values or ethos of the school.
While not explicit, it is assumed that values include Christian beliefs and practices held in
common. A person not expressing these values could be considered unsuitable for a position.
If schools can discriminate on the basis of the “the Christian values of the school”, then does
this lead to discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity and relationship
status? It will depend on the beliefs about sexuality that underpin these values. How might
this use of “the Christian values of the school” operate with LGBT teachers who claim Christ
as Lord?</p>
          <h4>Students</h4>
<p>In 2016, I wrote in <a href="/articles/whole_school/lgbt/" target="_blank" title="LGBT">The Challenge of LGBT students</a> about how schools include these students.
The article recommended inclusive welfare policies, especially in Christian schools where
these students were at greater risk because of negative views based on evangelical reformed
beliefs. Research indicated that: <i>Attempting to address the sexuality of these students with
negative teaching, threats, coercion, ridicule or even Biblical teaching that emphasises a
strong judgemental and intransigent position can result in them losing their identity and
their faith.</i> (Wood and Conley 2014). And this is without considering other student behaviours
towards these students. At the time, this article caused a lot of concern to some TCF
members who read it wrongly as an endorsement of LGBT lifestyles. Now nearly three years
on, the issue has been highlighted within the general community and will continue to create
discussion. It is hoped that more religious schools will make definitive statements about their
precepts and values that encourage inclusion of LGBT students and that welfare polices based
on love and not judgement will follow, reducing homophobia and the harassment of these
students.</p>
<h3>What do Christians believe about sexual orientation, gender identity
    and relationship status?</h3>
<p>The short answer is that beliefs vary across Christian groups depending on their interpretation
of the scriptures and traditions that underpin their beliefs. Sexual orientation remains a mine
field to explore. Some Christians have a liberal interpretation of scripture and others
traditional and scripture-based positions are far more judgemental.</p>
<p>In one recommended text <i>Kingdom Ethics</i> (2003) the traditional reformed evangelical
position, held by Sydney Anglicans, is that homosexual behaviours are prohibited by scripture
(sinful) and gay and lesbian people, acknowledging these sexual orientations exist, should
practice celibacy. It is interesting to note that one of the authors, David Gushee, has since
    written a book <i>Changing our mind </i>(2015) where he outlines a case for homosexuality referring
to all the key scriptural passages. There is much discussion still to be had about Christian
beliefs and values in relation to sexuality and the whole church will have to face these issues
not only schools.</p>
<p>With these diverse beliefs informing “the Christian values of the school”, many Christian
schools will continue to have an interest in a person’s sexual orientation seeking assurances
that intending applicants meet their “values” criteria.</p>
<p>Perhaps the greater challenge is gender identity especially where a person has or wishes to
change gender. How is this matter related to the “the Christian values of the school” should
they seek enrolment or employment?</p>
<p>It is a clear that many Christian groups believe that marriage can only be between a man and
a woman. Does that mean that Christians applying for positions who do not accept this
position will be excluded as not meeting “the Christian values of the school”?</p>
<p>While assurances have been forthcoming from Anglican and some other religious schools about
the acceptance of LGBT students and their continued enrolment, there have been no such
assurances about teachers. In fact, “the Christian values of the school” argument would seem
to indicate that current discrimination exemptions are to be pursued in any legislative
changes. As the church in general works through the scriptures to inform its beliefs and
values, LGBT people will continue to be a challenge, especially those who also identify as
Christians.</p>
