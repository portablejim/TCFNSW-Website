<h3>DEVELOPING A SUPPORTIVE SCHOOL
CONTEXT</h3>
<h4>Rob Spence, District Guidance Officer, Campbelltown</h4>
      <p><span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">A Model
for Effective Change</span><br
 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">
      <span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;"> Over my
thirty-three years in education I have introduced a number of
significant innovations in schools,</span><br
 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">
      <span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;"> and
systems changes at both local and regional levels. The model below is
based on action research as to</span><br
 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">
      <span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;"> why these
innovations were successful. The five concepts for effective change can
be applied to any</span><br
 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">
      <span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;"> project
within a school and not just in relation to behaviour management
systems.</span><br>

            <p>Try and establish a positive relationship<br>
with members of the school community<br>
before you try and affect change.</p>
            <p>Talk with a cross section of people.</p>
            <p>Ensure people can see a benefit for themselves.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Listen for the language used by others. Use the same
language and terminology. Be wary of your own jargon.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Be prepared to make changes to your original plan.</p>

            <p>It is usually not a good idea for your first encounter
with people to be based on trying to make changes!!</p>
            <p>&#8220;I am concerned about &#8230;&#8221;<br>
&#8220;I have been trying to think of how to<br>
address this issue.&#8221;<br>
&#8220;I was wondering if it would be good<br>
to &#8230;&#8221;<br>
&#8220;What are your thoughts?&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220;How would this benefit you?&#8221;<br>
&#8220;I can see &#8230;&#8221; or<br>
&#8220;I can hear &#8230;&#8221; or<br>
&#8220;It feels like &#8230;&#8221;</p>
            <p>Once you tune into other staff you<br>
may need to make changes to your<br>
original plan because you have<br>
become aware of some other ideas<br>
that are good and fit in with the needs<br>
of the school. The wider the<br>
ownership, the more chance the<br>
changes have of occurring.</p>
