<h2>Competition: A product
of the curse?</h2>
<h3>Standards-referenced</h3>
<p>The Genesis passage is very helpful in articulating the whole approach
to Christian assessment being standards-referenced. In education,
standards-referenced assessment is not new. Since the 1980s, NSW has
engaged in the basic skills tests, which measures student performance
against standards in the form of pre-tested questions on an achievement
scale with band cut-offs. Students are matched against the standard and
only in comparison to that performance against each other.</p>
      <br>
The HSC has adopted standards-referenced reporting and the School
Certificate program is heading that way in all subjects not just those
currently tested externally. The use of ever-expanding variations of
assessment methodology, provide reliable methods of assessing student
performance against standards. It should be noted that these standards
still have a touch of &#8220;normality&#8221; about them being based on the
performance of students in a particular cohort at a particular time. <br>
      <br>
The implications for teachers of this movement to standards-referenced
assessment is that they no longer have to rely on the competition of
student against student to achieve the best results by beating other
students. Teachers and students can focus on the standards and on
raising performance to meet these standards. As in Christian
communities, cooperation and harmony of purpose can be a goal so that
each person does his or her best against the standard. But nothing in
this life is perfect. The competition for university places, based on
ranking within the HSC process, means that students still feel the
pressure of competition against each other and, unfortunately, against
students within their own school to get a better course rank that will
influence the school-based assessment mark.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">The world and the spirit</span><br>
The Genesis reference has more to offer than the author has
contributed. There is no place for competition in the Garden. It is the
advent of sin and separation that sets humans against God and his
creation. Indeed, creation suffers from human sin and yearns to be also
brought back into harmony with the creator. In the post-fall world,
competition is a way of life and survival of the fittest takes on new
meaning. It is that survival instinct that breeds competitiveness and
the challenge for Christians is how to cope with it. Cooperation,
harmony and self-sacrifice are not the world&#8217;s way; they come by the
Spirit igniting those human qualities that reflect the very nature of
the creator. While cooperation, harmony and self-sacrifice might not be
exclusive to Christians, they are characteristics of God who in the
unity of relationship, Father, Son and Spirit experience no competition.<br>
      <br>
For Christian teachers in all schools, the challenge is to be in the
world but not of the world. When it come to competition, there is no
reason to agonise over voluntary involvement in, or viewing of,
competitive games, but to move the debate to a higher level about
whether our relationships, teaching pedagogy and school policies and
procedures promote competition or cooperation. Are students and staff
rewarded for working together or for winning which creates losers? <br>
      <br>
In some public schools, and I suspect non-government as well, merit
appointment and promotion can be about winning school-based
opportunities to demonstrate performance and about competing with other
teachers who pose a threat to appointments and promotions. When reading
some teacher&#8217;s applications I wonder when they ever find time to teach.
The sooner we have teaching standards to eliminate some of this form of
competition the better. And is the Senior Executive Service any better?
Short-term performance contacts create winners and losers amongst
senior officers, who need to be cooperating and setting joint, not
individual, goals to move an organisation, and just part of it,
forward. <br>
      <br>
Christians have an alternative way to competition, but they must
demonstrate it by their lives and in their areas of responsibility if
they are to win the right to promote it in the world.<br>
