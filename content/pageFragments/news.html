After retirement, Peter taught maths to groups of students for several years. He

For about 20 years he was Chairman of the Strata Committee of the Owner’s
Corporation of 18 villas at his residence.
He enjoys starting the day with a 30 minute walk around his village residence and
helps other residents with any problems eg replacing light globes and taking their
bins to the street for collection.
Peter joined TCF in 1950 when his was first appointed to Broken Hill. Later on he
was elected Chairman for several years.
“I want to thank the Blue Mountains City Council for selecting me as the local
Senior Citizen of the Year. This is an honour I feel I hardly deserve. My attitude
is summed up in one word – SERVICE. 
1) Service to Jesus Christ and to my family
and 2) service to people, especially in the Blue Mountains. I’m very thankful
that I have been a part of this wonderful community for 40 years.” Peter Kidd</p>
