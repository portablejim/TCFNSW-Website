<h2>Assessment, reporting and student self-esteem</h2>
    <p>In this issue of
TCFNews summaries of two Journal of Christian Education articles on
self-esteem have been published. They provide interesting insights into
how self-esteem has been an issue for education in the last ten years
and how many teachers are still attempting to comes to terms with
issues about their own self-esteem as well as how they might raise
students&#8217; self-esteem.</p>
      <br>
For students, one of the key influences on self-esteem can be their
success or lack of success at school. In recent years, there has been a
tendency to move away from both cohort reporting (position in class or
grade)and norm referencing (spreading the results over a bell shaped
curve where half get less then 50%)to provide more personalised
reporting and in some cases reporting against standards.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">The move to standards</span><br>
Education in the 1990s witnessed the rise of standards-referenced
reporting. The expansion of basic skills type tests into secondary
schools for literacy and numeracy was based on new measurement
techniques involving item response theory. The tests set up achievement
scales where the test items were ranked according to difficulty. These
scales allowed different student groups to be measured from one year to
the next against the standard represented by these scales and hence
improvements could be acknowledged. This is what governments had always
wanted, to know, whether the students were doing any better today then
yesterday. <br>
      <br>
Reporting on these tests was not only against standards which could
describe what students know and can do. Cohort reporting, although in
much broader terms than position in class, was also provided by the
percentages of students located in each of the bands. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">The HSC</span><br>
The well documented problems with the HSC in the McGaw Report 1996,
Their future, highlighted the confusion around courses and the
reporting of achievement which focused on norm referencing even through
the course means were set at 62. For many students, the subsequent
determination of a Tertiary Entrance Rank had become their sole focus,
so much so that they only paid second attention to &nbsp;<br>
subject marks. Half the number of students received TER scores below 50
and felt failures, while other capable students, even with scores in
the 90s felt a failure if their score did not provide access to their
preferred university course.<br>
      <br>
The government rightly wanted to take this focus off the TER and to get
it back onto what students know and can do so that after 13 years of
schooling students&#8217; achievements might be recognised. It was a radical
change, &#8220;courageous&#8221; as might be said in a Yes Minister episode, to
move the whole HSC away from norm-referenced reporting to
standards-referenced reporting. Students are now reported against
explicit standards (bands) which were set by student performance in the
first HSC examination in 2001.<br>
      <br>
The new HSC reporting format still provides cohort information in
subject reports with the graph of cohort performance beside the scale.
But the most controversial decision was to set a minimum standard in
each subject and to align this standard with a mark of 50. In fact,
this decision was based mostly on a community understanding that 50
represented a pass, irrespective of how it might have been determined
or what students knew and could do. Norm referencing destined half the
students to failure, no doubt a reason why the Board of Studies had
already lifted the mean to 62 for courses so that one standard
deviation of candidates below that mean would have a mark greater than
50.<br>
      <br>
There were two opposing arguments in allocating 50 marks to a minimum
standard. Using norm-referenced reporting, it was inappropriate in the
eyes of the public for half the students after 13 years of schooling to
fail, especially when this mark represented no comment on standards,
but student rank only. For others, the concern was that, with only
around 4% of students not reaching the minimum standard, this would be
seen as too small a proportion.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
From the beginning, teachers had difficulty with this minimum standard,
especially when they used the full range of marks in assessment tasks
with many students continuing to get marks of less than 50%, but ending
up with higher marks and bands at the HSC. For some students the
continually low marks in assessment tasks contributed to their sense of
failure and many voted with their feet and left school during or at the
end of Year 11. In regards to the HSC, marks, standards and self-esteem
are connected and the double&nbsp;&nbsp; standard of assessment marks
that don&#8217;t reflect standards affects self-esteem.<br>
      <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Primary schools &#8211;Different
problem, same result?</span><br>
Throughout the 1990s, primary schools have been encouraged to use
outcomes as the focus of teaching and learning and assessment and
reporting.<br>
      <br>
The move to assess and report student performance based on the
achievement of outcomes has been driven by the standards movement. The
key phrase has been &#8220;outcomes in a standards framework&#8221; and the first
serious attempt to do this was the 1994 national curriculum profiles
which set up eight levels of outcomes in each learning area. These
outcomes were independent of a student&#8217;s age or grade and therefore
constituted a measuring tape against which students work could be align
at any time during their schooling. The standard was described by the
outcomes, the level statement, the pointers (indicators) and the work
samples that illustrated the standard. <br>
      <br>
In NSW, the Eltis Report 1994 into the use of outcomes and profiles
recommended a different framework of outcomes in stages. The Board of
Studies developed its K-6 syllabuses and new Years 7-10 syllabuses on
this model. But the question is: Does this development of outcomes in
stages represent a reporting framework? Many thought that it did, or
should, and teachers were encouraged to keep records of student
achievement of each outcome and to report on each individual outcome. <br>
      <br>
The problem was, and still is in many cases, that what achievement of
each outcome looks like has not been established and understood
comparably by teachers. Without a well defined and generally understood
standard, teachers&#8217; reports against these standards (outcomes) are
idiosyncratic. Although the consistency of teacher judgements projects
have widened the understanding of some teachers, they do not yet
provide statewide standards for consistent judgements. To then, as some
schools do, place performance standards, 1-5 or A-E, on each outcome at
school reporting time brings no additional credit to schools, quite the
contrary.<br>
      <br>
It is in this context that the NSW Department of Education and Training
is to provide advice to schools on assessment and reporting.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Issues of self-esteem</span><br>
The JCE articles referred to in this issue make it clear that
self-esteem is found primarily in the love of God. He loves us, and
that worth is imputed, not earned. As Christians, we want our students
to know Jesus Christ as Lord and Saviour so that they might know and
experience the love of God as a base on which to build their
self-esteem. <br>
      <br>
The authors point out that the family, the school and the church all
have roles to play in developing and maintaining self-esteem.
Self-esteem based on achievements is always fragile as failure enters
life in the most unexpected way; often through broken relationships
which can bring down the highest of flyers. Self-esteem can be fragile
and easily upset. Its foundation in faith in the work of Jesus Christ
in reconciling us to God needs to be experienced in families and
churches as well as being known. Christian communities everywhere need
to watch that they don&#8217;t inadvertently destroy the self-esteem of
Christians by unbalanced presentations of aspects of doctrine. As Paul
reminds us &#8220;Watch your life and doctrine closely&#8221; (1Tim:4:16).<br>
      <br>
Christians need to be involved in the current debates about assessment
and reporting and the TCF Conference, Could do better: Assessment and
school reports, will be one opportunity to do this. It will raise more
issues than it will solve, but being informed is essential if we are to
influence the debate. <br>
      <br>
Some of the things that we need to think about from a Christian
perspective are: <br>
&#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;If we are to report against standards, what are
these standards in the primary years and Years 7-10 and how can they be
comparably understood by teachers across NSW? <br>
&#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Is what I am putting on my school reports based on
evidence aligned to well understood standards or are they simply my
best guesses?<br>
&#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;How can I fairly assess all students using a full
range of marks if everyone sees 50 as a pass?<br>
&#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Are assessment and reporting practices in my school
building up, or breaking down, students&#8217; self-esteem?<br>
