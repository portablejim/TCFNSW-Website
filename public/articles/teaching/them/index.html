 <h3>THEM</h3>         
    <p>Refugees, asylum seekers, boat people, displaced people and visa over stayers. How do primary
teachers and secondary teachers of geography, history and English deal with the controversial
issues that these labels bring? What approach should Christian teachers take to the issues that
        arise?</p>
          <h3>A brief reminder of our history</h3>
<p>The history of Australia is laced with racism. First Aboriginal people, then Chinese on the gold
fields and Kanaka on the sugar coast and then after World War 11 waves of migrants from Europe,
then Vietnam, the middle east, China, India and Africa making Australia a truly multicultural
country. Yet, throughout this process there has always been opposition, most exemplified in the
“White Australia” Policy after Federation and in later times concern for the changes immigration
has brought. These people were different and clashed with contemporary practice. Australia does
not have a good record on accepting such differences. But despite this, migrant groups have
become part of Australia and British background Australians have learnt to embrace features of
their cultural, not only food. Throughout this process there has been the them and us, but
expressed in a most Australian way. For example, I have an adopted Indian son and people would
sometimes comment to me about how migrants were taking Australian jobs. When I replied “like
my son”, they would often respond, “No, he’s one of us”. A strange acceptance. But often it’s the
people we know that are accepted, irrespective of their background, but all those others out
there, well, that’s a different story. Australians express a fear of the other as observed in attitudes
towards the latest migrant group. They don’t know THEM. There is little point teaching about
refugees, migration, asylum seekers, boat people, displaced people and visa overstayers unless we
          know our history, however uncomfortable much of it might be.</p>
         <h3> Numbers</h3>
<p>When teaching about population, migration, refugees and displaced people, background history is
needed if contemporary issues are to be addressed. Then the facts. What are the figures on the
ethnic backgrounds of Australians? What are the numbers for the current intake of migrants and
refugees? Which countries are represented in this intake? How many asylum seekers have been
granted refugee status and how many are being held in detention? How many, and from which
countries, are estimated to have overstayed their visas and are living in the community? Knowing
    the facts can help diffuse some stereotypes.</p>
         <h3> What is the focus?</h3>
          <p>Knowing the background and having the facts can be brought to bear on the issue or question at
hand. Some examples might include:
<ul>
<li>Can Australia sustain the current rate of increase in population?</li>
 <li>What are the implications of decreased immigration and refugee intakes?</li>
 <li>Can Australia develop a cohesive society with diverse migrant and refugee inputs?</li>
<li> Is it desirable to break up migrant ghettos?</li>
 <li>How does Australia deal with asylum seekers?</li>
 <li>How does Australia compare with other nations on migration, refugees and asylum seekers?</li>
 <li>How many is too many?</li>
 <li>How do Australians support migrants and refugees?</li>
<li>What problems are created for Australia by its intake of migrants and refugees?</li>
<li> What have been the benefits and problems created by developing a multicultural Australia?</li>
    </ul>
<p>These and other questions are all legitimate for study. Knowing the history and having the facts
available will help any classroom discussion and debate. However, students like their parents, are
likely to have strong opinions often based on prejudice, media stereotypes and ignorance. Teachers
will need to follow guidelines for dealing with controversial issues like the NSW Department’s
policy document <a href="https://education.nsw.gov.au/policy-library/policies/controversial-issues-in-schools" target ="_blank" title="Controversial Issues in Schools">https://education.nsw.gov.au/policy-library/policies/controversial-issues-in-schools</a></p>
<h3>Christian teachers</h3>
          <p>So, what does a Christian teacher do when preparing topics that cover this subject matter:<br>
<strong>1. Provide context</strong><br>
Students need to understand why they are studying in this area and how these studies will
contribute to their greater understanding of the world they live in, and, in particular, the
Australian society. The Christian teacher will be particularly interested in helping their
students to understand others and how their own lives connect with other people and fit into
current circumstances. Understanding “the other” is fundamental to relationships and sharing
faith. They will want to address stereotypes, media perceptions and fallacies of composition –
what one person does is what the whole group does.<br>
<strong>2. Provide background</strong><br>
As argued above, students need to know some history of Australia involving migrants, refugees
and asylum seekers. Without some understanding of this history it will be difficult for them to
understand the attitudes of different groups within Australia. The Christian teacher will be
concerned that their students recognise the histories of people groups in Australia as a way of
bridging the gap of understanding and removing the threat of the other. Some understanding
of the cultures they come from will also help.<br>
<strong>3. Explore cultural differences</strong><br>
To understand the background of many of the people new to Australia it will be necessary to
study aspects of their culture, including religion that is a key motivating factor for many. The
Christian teacher will be concerned that students learn to accept difference, but nor all
differences are good, and learning to respect the right of others to live differently can be a
key to acceptance. They should learn about different religions, but not engage in their
practices.<br>
<strong>4. Let the facts speak for themselves.</strong><br>
Truth is particularly important for Christian teachers because it relates to the very nature of
God. Pursuing truth is fundamental to Christian teaching. In this topic, in which there will be
conflicting opinions and adopted prejudices, the Christian teacher can point students to study
factual information which will address many of their prejudices and concerns, cut through
their stereotypes and give them a sense of empowerment to look further at the issues.<br>
<strong>5. Control discussion</strong><br>
Students with diverse opinions or minority opinions may feel intimidated within the whole
class setting. Providing discussion questions and using group structures will help promote
discussion and force students to justify their opinions and seek consensus within their groups.
Christian teacher will want students to be involved in authentic discussions, not simply the
sharing of ignorance and prejudice. To understand others, students will need to engage and
not be passive listeners.<br>
<strong>6. Include Bible reference for discussion.</strong><br>
The scriptures have a lot to say about caring for outsiders and for neighbours. Select a couple
of passages and have the students discuss them in reference to the focus of the study. There is
nothing to stop Christian teachers in public schools using this approach as long as it is nondenominational and aimed at promoting open-ended discussion relevant to the topic. Knowing
what Christians think can be helpful for all students.</p>
<p>At a time when many Christians seem focussed on their rights to freedom of religion, there would
appear to be much more in scripture about the needs of the poor, the foreigner and the outcast.
Teachers should not shy away from difficult or controversial topics in the curriculum or treat them
superficially to avoid argument and conflict. These are the very topics that allow Christians to
impact on their students through approaches that show integrity and respect for others. Lessening
the THEM and uplifting the US is consistent with promoting the love of Christ in a community where
all individuals need acceptance, love, and forgiveness.
