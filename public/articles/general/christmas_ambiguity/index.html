    <h3>The ambiguity of Christmas in a post-Christian society</h3>
   
      <p>As 2002 draws to a
close, I find myself once again caught in the duality of Christmas
created by the tension between the celebration of our faith and a
secular celebration of a holiday. </p>
     <p>There are still plenty of signs of Christmas in the world, carols in
the mall, carols by candlelight and the activities of many churches as
they try to get the real message of Christmas to a community many of
whom have long given up on a religious celebration in favour of family
reunion, holidays and fun.<br>
      <br>
 <p>Hey, wait a minute, that sounds like me. Yes, the problem for
Christians, especially Christian teachers with the end of school this
year so close to Christmas Day, is that the world&#8217;s celebration sounds
so much like our celebration. Yes, we will go to church on Christmas
Day, we will say grace at Christmas dinner, we might even sing happy
birthday to Jesus and have a cake so that the children understand
Jesus&#8217; birthday but its still - family reunion, holidays and fun that
will fill our time. <br>
      <br>
 <p>How should we react to this criticism of our celebration of Christmas?<br>
Three possible reactions are: </p>
     
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Do nothing</span><br>
 <p>As Christians we have been freed from the legalism and expectations of
the society we live in. Our whole life needs to be a celebration of the
faith we have in Christ and what he has done for us in coming into the
world and sacrificing his life for us so that we might know God.&nbsp;
Christians ought to celebrate with all joy and excitement and
especially at Christmas time.&nbsp; Live, enjoy Christmas, the holidays
and the fun, secure in the knowledge that Christ is Lord and that your
real home is with God. </p>
   
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Keeping the traditions</span><br>
 <p>The desire of many Christians to continue to have an impact on the
world will encourage them to keep the traditions. They will look to
remind a society, drifting further and further from its creator, that
Christ is still the issue that challenges their life. They will support
carol by candlelight, look for Christmas cards with Christian symbols
and messages (an ever decreasing commodity in secular stores), be
involved in school, church and social functions celebrating Christmas,
recognise Christ on Christmas Day by attending church, praying at
Christmas dinner, putting a cross and angels on the Christmas tree,
exchanging presents as recognition of what God has given us and in
generally looking to maintain all the symbols and traditions. </p> 
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Reaching out</span><br>
 <p>For many Christians, Christmas is a time to reach out to others. It&#8217;s a
time to invite others, who may not have somewhere else to go, to your
home for Christmas lunch. It&#8217;s about giving time and money to the
charities that bring a Christian message of hope and encouragement with
practical giving to those who fear Christmas as a time of loneliness,
poverty and depression. It&#8217;s about being active in supporting your
church and reaching out to others, about giving generously because of
what God has given to us. </p>
   
 <p>I pray that this Christmas might be one that captures all three of
these approaches and gives the world the message that Christ is alive
and well this
Christmas.
      </p>
