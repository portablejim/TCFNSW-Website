          <h2>Technology: What the Bible says</h2>
<p>John Capper</p>
     
      <p> Technology is not a word to be found in the Bible. What is
found is a God who is the creator of all, the master designer and the
source of all change. Technology like everything else has its source in
God. In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth and part of
that creation was humans. After this work, he viewed his creation, he
was satisfied and he rested. As part of that rest, humans discovered
that being created in the image of God they had carried characteristics
that would allow them to also be creative, so much so that they could
even reject God.</p>
      <p>Since the Fall, work has taken a two fold meaning as both
satisfaction and drudgery as humans learnt to till the soil. Humans had
learnt that everything God have given them could be used to enhance
their relationship with him or to break it. There was the possibility
of harmony and disharmony.</p>
      <p>Technology in harmony with God can build an Ark and the Temple
of Jerusalem and in disharmony the Tower of Babel. Technology in
harmony with creation can beat swords into ploughshares and in
disharmony pollute, destroy and disfigure. Technology in harmony with
others produce music, writing, housing and in disharmony war,
oppression and broken relationships. Technology in harmony with self
can lead to music, praise, clothing, fellowship and in disharmony
self-mutilation and self-destructive behaviours.</p>
      <p>Technology is, at one level, morally neutral. It can be used
to promote harmony or to disrupt it. The two exist side by side in the
same way that in Christ we live at the one time in the world and in the
Kingdom. Human beings can engage technology for good and for evil.
Christians need to engage with the technology with a view to the
framework of faith and morality which is part of their relationship
with God.</p>
      <p>In education it does not matter whether it is new or old
technology, books, radio, television or the Internet, teachers and
students need to have the skills and moral framework to choose wisely
the applications of technology they wish to engage and the content
associated with those applications. Such wisdom has its source in the
character of God and the perfect reflection, Jesus Christ.</p>
