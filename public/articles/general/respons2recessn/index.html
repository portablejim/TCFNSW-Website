      <h2>Article: Christian responses to recession</h2>
 
<p>Recessions are often caused by greed. Too many people aspiring to
assets they can not afford, too much chasing a bull run on the stock
market, too much reliance on superannuation lump sums being invested in
risky or single areas of the money market, too much reliance on an
increasing property market. </p>
<p>As we have seen recently, all these areas can go into reverse and
peoples saving and income can be greatly affected. However, as much as
those with substantial assets might be affected in the short term, the
real concern will be the decreased employment opportunities as a
slowdown in economic growth affects business and leads to unemployment.
In Australia, the budget surpluses of the last five years will be
available to government to initiate infrastructure projects that will
employ more and soften the unemployment, but I am not sure how much
additional buying and employment growth will be generated for the
government handouts that are occurring across the community. Will they
be spent or will they be saved? Will they generate more demand for
goods and services thus creating or maintaining employment or will they
be used to pay off debt and reduce credit card balances? </p>
<p>The problem here is that not everyone is worse off in a recession.
Those who keep their jobs, have reduced interest payments on a home
mortgage and benefit from lower inflation are better off then they were
12 months ago. Those on fixed incomes often indexed for inflation are
also better off. However, those relying on jobs in manufacturing when
demand falls, those who reply on tourism when people stop travelling,
especially from overseas, and those associated with hospitality and
associated services including air travel are going to be the hardest
hit. Maintaining employment will be a first priority.</p>
<p>In a recession, there is greater competition for causal jobs which
until recently have been plentiful in an almost fully employed economy,
but now there will be that many more people competing for these jobs.
Those who find it difficult to get employment will now find themselves
locked out. In these families economic hardship will become the reality
and their lifestyle will have to adjust to just cope with the basics of
food, clothing and shelter.</p>
<p>As teachers and educators we have job security and superannuation.
As retired teachers we have superannuation in one form or another and,
especially if taken as an annuity, recessions have little effect. Many
of us are well placed to weather this recession and many of our
churches comprise mainly employed people who will similarly survive the recession. </p>
<p>As Christians, our response to a recession should not be a smug I&#8217;ll
be OK but a concern for those who will not be OK. Our support might be
needed within our own families where other members of the household
lose their job or can not get casual work that they have been relying
on to supplement the household income. These people we know about and
are drawn into helping, but in churches where people don&#8217;t like to
admit that they have lost their job and are in financial difficulties,
we often don&#8217;t hear about, or have the communication channels to know
when someone is in financial trouble. </p>
<p>As Christians, we are not good at talking about money and don&#8217;t
share much about our own finances or ask others about theirs. But we
are good at contributing to charities that help others in need. Such
contributions are more anonymous and don&#8217;t require us to be challenged
by the personal contact with someone who is really doing it tough. While supporting and encouraging such giving, I am sure that we are
called to provide a much more holistic response of caring for those in
need. As well as money, they may need the emotional support of someone
who cares enough to sit and listen and help maintain their self-esteem
during a time that is deflating and depressing. Some will need practical help like a baby sitter so that they can do a casual job or
engage in a training course, or they will need transport, or someone to
mind the children after school. </p>
<p>All our school systems have values about caring. This is a time to be practical in talking about these values with students. Within our
schools, churches and local communities there are going to be people who need support during this recession. A recession provides additional
times to share practically God&#8217;s love. It also provides a challenge to our giving, both to our local church and God&#8217;s work generally. Above
all, it is not a time to accumulate wealth, but a time to be generous with the resources God has given us.</p>
