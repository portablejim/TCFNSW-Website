is an important agenda </h3>
     
      <p>
Some people might be wondering why TCFNSW has historically been so
interested in values and values education. They may observe that their
school has a statement of values and that it is there for all to see,
much like mission statements were around in the early 1990s. The
question is: what affect does a statement or policy have on the every
day life of the school? Not much, I hear some say.</p>
      <br>
For government schools the background to recent initiatives in values
education has been very significant. In NSW schools in the 1970s, there
was an opening up of curriculum to a school based approach in both
primary and secondary schools. Teachers were faced with questions about
what knowledge to teach, what skills to develop and how values could be
taught in lessons. In the area of values, the 1974 &#8220;Base paper&#8221; on
curriculum talked about &#8220;moral autonomy&#8221;.&nbsp; Many saw this as
situational ethics (moral principles vary with circumstances) and moral
relativism (no moral principle is more important than another.).
Considerable debate followed and many teachers were uncomfortable about
what was intended by &#8220;moral autonomy&#8221; and some wanted to label it as a
&#8220;values free&#8221; approach to education. <br>
      <br>
Some of these concerns were reinforced in the 1980s by an increased
focus in classrooms on values clarification approaches to teach
values.&nbsp;&nbsp; Its openness to all values positions led to it
being attacked as being a &#8220;values neutral&#8221; approach.&nbsp; The 1980s
became increasingly dominated by a community view that public schools
were &#8220;values free&#8221; and &#8220;values neutral&#8221;. This view was further
compounded by the lack of any statement by the Department about the
values of public schools or the teaching of values. In these
circumstances, some parents believed that Catholic schools and the
newly growing Christian schools would offer their children a
recognisable values base and so they left public schools.<br>
      <br>
In 1988 to address these matters, the Director-General developed the
document many of you would know called &#8220;The values we teach&#8221;. This
document stated the learning, personal and civic values that public
education stood for and carried some contextual information that
supported an approach to values education.<br>
Iimplementation was never required and little support was provided. The
values we teach mainly sat as a policy statement to answer the critics
of public schools as being &#8220;values free&#8221; and &#8220;values neutral&#8221;. As was
the case with many non-government schools, some government schools did
establish a school policies so that they could be accountable to
parents who might ask a question about values. <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Values education more than a
policy</span> <br>
      <br>
Values education is not simply about having a policy, no matter how up
to date or cutting edge that policy might be. Values education is about
what goes on each day in classrooms and in every interaction in the
school community. While policy can set the standards and the
expectations, plans strategies and implementation are what is required
to make all members of the school community take notice of the policy.<br>
      <br>
The Department&#8217;s policy, Values in NSW public schools has a number of
excellent features. <a
 href="https://detwww.det.nsw.edu.au/policies/A-Zindex/index.shtml">https://detwww.det.nsw.edu.au/policies/A-Zindex/index.shtml</a>
and select from the &#8220;v&#8221; and then the policy.<br>
      <br>
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It recognises the reality, that we are teaching
values every day through what we do and say, whether we intend to or
not.<br>
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It reaffirms that public schools have always
taught values <br>
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It identifies an inclusive set of core values that
encompass a range of secular and religious world views. <br>
4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It articulates core values and an approach to be
taken by school communities and classroom teachers. <br>
5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It distinguishes between the values associated
with behaviour, teaching subjects and substantive issues in the
community. More about this in a moment.<br>
6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It acknowledges that greater explicitness is
needed in schools and classrooms about values<br>
7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It recognizes the need for schools to communicate
its values. <br>
8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It outlines an approach to values education that
is multifaceted and comprehensive and neither limited to one area of
teaching or school activity nor restricted to additional one-off
programs.<br>
      <br>
Of these excellent features I want to focus on just a few. The
statement that <span style="font-style: italic;">the values encompass
a range of secular and religious world views</span> is significant.
Although not a specifically Christian document, Christians will be
comfortable with it. Although not entirely a secular document, people
with secular world views will be comfortable with it because it
embraces a set of core values accepted in common across the community. <br>
      <br>
The second important feature is its comprehensiveness. The document is
about classroom teaching, policies, procedures, communications, and
relationships. It is about the core values permeating all aspects of
school life. The other side of this point is that the policy
discourages additional programs, one off events or activities and
single subjects as being appropriate vehicles to carry the values
agenda. Whole school means everyone and everything.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
The key strategies are discussion and reflection, to think about the
core values in every situation and to talk about them with others. In a
practical way, reflection and discussion can improve planning where
what schools wish to do can be measured against the core values. They
can form a set of standards to guide both planning and behaviours. They
also form a great set of measures for any evaluation.<br>
      <br>
Lastly, but perhaps most importantly, the classroom remains the focus
of schools and learning. Here teachers simply need to bring to the
surface the values that are all through the curriculum and their
teaching strategies. Asking students to reflect on what values are
operating when they discuss any action or express any opinion will
quickly make the values real to students and help them to understand
them in a variety of contexts. This involvement allows students to
learn what the values mean. <br>
      <br>
However, any lesson could proceed without ever reflecting on these
values by bringing them to the surface. In such cases the opportunity
for values education is lost.<br>
      <br>
Whether a government or non government school, the opportunities for
values education are ubiquitous. However, if not taken up by teachers
then the opportunities are lost and schools may well have a policy and
values will be taught, but whether the two match will be for the
judgement of parents and students.<br>
