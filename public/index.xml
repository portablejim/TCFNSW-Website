      <description>Disclaimer: This article is the opinion of the author and does not necessarily reflect that of all Teachers&#39; Christian Fellowship members.
NSW curriculum review interim report: First impressions The overriding impression of this interim report is that change is about to occur which reduces the content of the curriculum in favour of improving the ways students learn and their skills for life and employment. The key features are the construction of the curriculum in attainment levels that are independent of age and grade with a focus on the school assessment of achievement, including in senior years modules of new advanced and vocational courses.</description>

      <title>Curriculum versus pedagogy: Does it have to be?</title>

      <description>Disclaimer: This article is the opinion of the author and does not necessarily reflect that of all Teachers&#39; Christian Fellowship members.
Introduction – the issues Just a couple of years ago, the Australian curriculum was endorsed for implementation and already NSW is having a curriculum review. There are many reasons for a review including:
  inadequacies within the Australian curriculum;  the concerns of teachers about overcrowding in the curriculum;  the effects of prescribed curriculum on pedagogy;  the excessive focus on NAPLAN tests and the skewing of both the curriculum and pedagogy to meet community expectations about improving standards in literacy and numeracy;  the data from international testing instruments showing that Australian schools are falling behind other nations.</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/articles/general/public-schools-fight/</guid>
      <description>Disclaimer: This article is the opinion of the author and does not necessarily reflect that of all Teachers&#39; Christian Fellowship members.
Public Schools fight back? In recent weeks (July 2018), there has been considerable ideological debate about whether public schools should continue to support selective schools. This is partly a debate about whether public schools should be local and comprehensive or cater for specialist needs including intellectual superiority. In an education textbook, the debate would be along traditional lines, but today’s arguments have a social context, with historical and political heritages, that are affected by the current makeup of the Australian population, social expectations about schools and, of course, funding.</description>
